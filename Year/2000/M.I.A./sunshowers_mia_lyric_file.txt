

I bongo with My Lingo
Beat it like a wing yo
From Congo to Colombo
Can't stereotype my thing yo

I salt and pepper my Mango
Shoot Spit  Out the window
Bingo I got him in the thing yo

Quit bending all my Fingo
Quit beating me like you're a ringo
You wanna go?
You wanna win a war?
Like p.L.O I don't surrender

Sunshowers that fall on my troubles
Are over you, My baby
And Some Showers I'll be aiming at you
Cause I'm watching you, My baby

I bongo with My Lingo
Beat it like a wing yo
From Congo to Colombo
Can't stereotype my thing yo

I checked that mouth on him
Fucking Checked that gas on him
I had him, Cornered him
Fucking Shut that gate on him

Why would you listen to him?
He had his way  I'm bored of him
I'm tired of him
I don't wanna be as bad as him

It's a bomb yo
So run yo
Put away your stupid gun yo
Cause see through like a protocol call
Which is why we blow it up 'for we go

Sunshowers that fall on my troubles
Are over you, My baby
And Some Showers I'll be aiming at you
Cause I'm watching you, My baby 

Semi-9 and snipered him
On that wall they posted him
They cornered him
And then just murdered him

He Told them he didn't know them
He wasn't there, they didn't know him
They showed him a picture then ;
"Ain't that you with the Muslims?"

He got Colgate on his teeth
And Reebok classics on his feet
At a factory he does Nike
And then he helps the family

Beat heart Beat
He's made it to the newsweek
Sweetheart Seen it
He's doing it for the Peeps... Peace

Sunshowers that fall on my troubles
Are over you, My baby
And Some Showers I'll be aiming at you
Cause I'm watching you, My baby
