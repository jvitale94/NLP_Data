

I was missin' in action
On the side of a carton
I was taken in a Datsun
From a street in Acton 

I was sipping on a Rubicon
Thinking 'bout where I come
Its all this for revolution
Cuttin' up the coupon
Saving for a telephone
Can I call home
Please Can I go Home 

Painted nails, sunsets on horizons
Palm trees silhouette smells amazing
Blindfolds under home made lanterns
Somewhere in the Amazon
They're holding me Ransom 

Hello This is M.I.A.
Could you please Come get me 

Smoking on a Benson
Tryin' to get me undone
Let Me Go
I don't want your attention
Under Submission
Out of frustration I'll do it
I'll scream for the nation 

Painted nails, sunsets on horizons
Palm trees silhouette smells amazing
Blindfolds under home made lanterns
Somewhere in the Amazon
They're holding me Ransom 

Hello This is M.I.A.
Could you please Come get me 

Minutes turned to hours
And Became our dates
When We Shared raindrops
That turned into Lakes
Bodies started Merging
And the lines got grey
Now I'm looking at him thinking
Maybe He's okay 

Hello This is M.I.A
It's okay You forgot me
