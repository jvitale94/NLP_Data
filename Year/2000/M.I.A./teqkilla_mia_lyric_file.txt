

Johnie keep walking, Jack does too much coke
Jim Beam and Jameson, they just gave me joke
When I see Perno, I say oh hell no
Kahlua's a turn off, I tell him to Smirnoff
Captin Morgan, a shake with sparks
When we hang out, he shoots arrows through my heart
Blue tattoo, chillin up in Malibu
He got 99 Bananas, but he ain't my booooooo

I got sticky sticky ikky ikky wiiiiiiiiiiiid
I got a shot of tquila in me

I got sticky sticky ikky ikky wiiiiiiiiiiiid
I got a shot of tquila in me

When I met segrams
Sent chivez down my spine
got me on the dance floor
then we start to wine
His ex sambuka
She jus a hooker
I put it on a chilla but
I want to quil a

I got sticky sticky ikky ikky wiiiiiiiiiiiid
I got a shot of tquila in me
