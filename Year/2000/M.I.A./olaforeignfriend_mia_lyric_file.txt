Breaking order like a leader now follow
Popping a collar, yea hustle a dollar
You can't touch us like MC Hammer
Eat my mum's string hoppers, jump in the chopper
Yea, chop up a mango with salt and pepper
Holla, holla, holla, true scholar with the nona
And I'm here to shine the light on the matter


At the border I see the patroller cruising past in their car
Creeping in my socks and slipper
Mexicans say hola!
At the border I see the patroller cruising past in their car
Hiding in my Toyota Corolla, everybody say Y.A.L.A.!


Baller, a baller, got a friend called Burma
And he looks at Obama when we burner
It's a Bamboo Banga
And you know I'm coming back with power
Yea 64 Impala, Hummer or Toyota
When I drive in I'm a winner
Whatever I'm a rapper got fuel in the burner
Off the grid, staying off the radar




Yea, shoot at a shooter, yea shoot a computer
Pour yourself a shot of teqkilla
Time for a banger, throw up your middle finger
I'm a writer competition we gon murder
I'm a fighter and a lover like winter and summer
I ain't really looking for no drama




Most of the things I do, they banned it
But I'm a still do it, I'm a bandit
I'm a still, I'm a still, I'm a still, I'm a still
But I'm a still do it, I'm a bandit
Most of the things I do, they banned it
But I'm a still do it, I'm a bandit
I'm a still, I'm a still, I'm a still, I'm a still
But I'm a still do it, I'm a bandit
Bandit bandit, ba-bandit
Bandit bandit, ba-bandit


Get a house, pay rent, your help is God sent
Better tell somebody, women and men
Don't be ignorant, when I'm on ten
Better tell somebody, I'm an immigrant
When I jump that fence I'm gon get a Benz
Then I leave my tent and I gon be your foreign friend
I gon' be your foreign friend
Then I leave my tent and I gon be your foreign friend
I'd much rather stay in a hot country
We come to cold countries cause we have to
But I like it hot
When I jump that fence I gon get a Benz
Then I leave my tent and can be a foreign friend
