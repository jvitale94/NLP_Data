

If you ever leave
Then I’ll have to give up everything that I believe
Life is nothing but just a fantasy
Since he took away the love that’s left in me
Please talk to me, did you ever fight for me?
And how come I stand by you if I can’t find my feet?
Now you can’t stand me, make me your enemy
Now what did I do for you to call me crazy?
If you see a certain shade, focus your mind array
Here’s a mixtape that I made, let’s take a break
Don’t wanna fuss away, baby if it’s too late
While I get my life sorted here's a mixtape

It’s new but it’s for you to be seen
So it’s all way for all
So far away for me

When you hit your face, tore me up like lace
Yea, what’s it for?
We’re just another case
Hurt does leave a trace
Love’s the darkest phase
And this hole is deeper than the fall that I embrace

Did you fight for me? Did you cry for me?
And how come I stand by you if I can’t find my feet?
If you see a certain shade, focus your mind array
Here’s a mixtape that I made, let’s take a break
Don’t wanna fuss away, baby if it’s too late
While I get my life sorted here's a mixtape

Oh my baby… oh my baby
Oh why? Oh my
Oh my baby… oh my baby
Oh why? Oh my

Did you fight for me? Did you cry for me?
And how come I stand by you if I can’t find my feet?
If you see a certain shade, focus your mind array
Here’s a mixtape that I made, let’s take a break
Don’t wanna fuss away, baby if it’s too late
While I get my life sorted here's a mixtape


Please, let me sit down beside you
I’ve got something to tell you, darling
You wanna know
I just can’t wait, no not another day
I love you more than words can say
