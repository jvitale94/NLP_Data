I spy with my little eye something that can get you high
High, high, high, high
High, high, high, high...


Does this a good genie start
When you say it I can just 
Conquered in a 
‘Cause it may not honka honka
I star Mr Gangasta, with the move from the hip
That chocha
Get the leg and the tie I’mma watch ya
Take a break what’s your  on my sofa?
I like the wine
I’mma suffer watching television ‘cause I’m the radio
I come into your intermission, my bees are here
And they calling on my transmission and didn’t know why
And I hit the transactions 

I spy with my little eye something that can get you high
High, high, high, high
High, high, high, high

I break you in like shoes on my new jeans
I go within, I’mma spun that in your work thing
I’m wishing one more,  dirty things
I’mma make you swing from my beans into new things
Your leg’s a lot lump, looking lumpier
I can cross in from my home to Jamaica
In the street birds trade for my signal
Cover me all if you wanna bend now
Is today our fire star time?
Ain’t thinking ‘bout shit in 
Cut burn I’m shipped to Asia
I’m adopted, paddle in the lake, yeah

I spy with my little eye something that can get you high
High, high, high, high
High, high, high, high...
