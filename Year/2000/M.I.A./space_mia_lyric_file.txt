It grabs at me like harmony.
The stars are bangin' close to me,
As I'm floatin' in a life odyssey.

My lines are down, you can't call me,
As I fly around in space odyssey.
My lines are down, you can't call me,
As I fly around in space odyssey.

Like Puzzle Bobble on PC,
It's got color waves following me.
And I still judge it week by week,
And I'm ahead of time, so you'll never lose me.

My lines are down, you can't call me,
As I fly around in space odyssey.
My lines are down, you can't call me,
As I fly around in space odyssey.

Ohh... Ah, ah ah...

Can I take a minute or two,
To introduce my point of view?
I need to spend some time with you,
There's nothing more new on the news.

My lines are down, you can't call me,
As I fly around in space odyssey.
My lines are down, you can't call me,
As I fly around in space odyssey.
