

They told me this is a free country
And now it feels like a chicken factory
I feel couped up I wanna bust free
Got nothing to lose if you get me

Like a Taliban trucker, eating boiled up yucca
I keep my eyes down like I'm in a black burka
Been through shit yeah it's a fucker 
Now I make tunes say shaka laka laka
Shaka laka lee, shaka laka la, shaka lakalakalaka lucky lucky me
If you check me, I check you 
If they kick you, then I back you
Say somthin' new, say somthin' cool
I give you my time, but I ain't no fool
Acca Acca I, breaker, breaker jaw every every time, someone steps on my toe

I fight the ones that fight me
I really love alot 
I really love alot 
I really love alot 
I really love alot,
But I fight the ones that fight me 
But I fight the ones that fight me 
I fight the ones who fight me 
But I fight the ones that fight me

Who's in town
Them no like me, me no like dem
Like hu jintao
Instead of them I got a new found jem
Someone I can love up like men
Like Obama needs to love up chen
Like a hand me down sucker throwing bombs out to mecca
Call it goodwill, get money to get better
Keep ya head down like a unicef worker
If you get hit you can't question the fucker
How come how come I, yeah but yeah but why?
If I be the f, who the f, b the I
If you met me then you'll get me but if you get me, will you get a fee
Shit menu be free where's bob marley
And I won't turn my cheek like I'm ghandi

I fight the ones that fight me!
