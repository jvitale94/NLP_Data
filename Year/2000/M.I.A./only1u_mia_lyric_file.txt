Ding 

Just cause the game is up
Didn’t mean I didn’t win
I got three aces and a king
I begun love of financiable things
That’s why my instincts kicks in
Matter if you win
It’s based on what you bring
That’s the feeling in the chest with the drink
Your telephone rings
But you ain’t listenin
So motherfucker now I’m steppin’ in

There’s only one you, you, you, you 
Ding 


Lara Croft is soft
When it comes to my stuff
She’s made up. I’m real!
I’m a Lady of Rage, with an afro puff
Who else can say the things they feel?
More jiggy than Will
From a mouth to a chub
There’s no bee I cannot kill, kill, kill.
S-s-still chill upon a hill
Like I’m poppin’ a pill
There’s no other things I want to feel

There’s only one you, you, you, you 
Ding 

There’s trillions of cash
And there’s billions of us
And there’s millions of things that can happen with this stuff
And there’s thousands that will crash
And there’s hundreds that will smash
There’s only one you and I'mma drink to that

There’s only one you 
Ding 


Come on, let go, let me go take off
Tonight’s the one
Cause’ tomorrow may never come
Fucking all day
Every night is gonna be mine
Making money is fine
But your life is one of a kind.
