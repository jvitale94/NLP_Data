I woke up like this, I went to bed like this
We do everything just like this
Pretty and witty we're more than just a slutty girl
On a committee for Haiti or political
We do it boss, big and heavy like a fatty girl
Necessity, unity in every girl
My surfboard bitches ride waves love all day
Man I can hear everything you say
My surfboard bitches ride waves love all day
Men and women are 50/50

Na-na-na, diva is a female version of a hustla, of a hustla, of a, of a hustla...

Stop the track, lemme state facts
I told you, gimme a minute and I'll be right back
Fifty million 'round the world and they say that I couldn't get it
I done got so sick and filthy with Benjis, I can't spend it
How you gon' be talkin' shit? You act like I just got up in it
Been the number one diva in this game for a minute!
I know you read the paper - the one that they call the Queen
Every radio 'round the world know me cause that's where I be (first!)
