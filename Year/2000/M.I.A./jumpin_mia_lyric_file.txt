Jump in, jump in...

Zip up my jacket
Put my phone in my pocket
Keep my mind open
I'm tryna not to lock it
I make a plan
Put it in god's hand
And jump in to that van

Jump in, ju...

Wake up wake up
Your life on take up
Go thank that maker
Get your life on fleek and take off
You got to keep that shit fine

I gon' make you mine
When I see that border I gon' cross the line
When I see that dream I gon' make it mine
We go we go take off take off
Go hit the sea hit the sea like...
Noah's ark illegal

Jump in, ju...
