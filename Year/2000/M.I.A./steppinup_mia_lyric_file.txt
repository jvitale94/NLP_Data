

Steppin up in this club, with my tool bag 
Rub a dub, rub a dub dub, rub a rub a dub dub 


I light up like a genie and I blow up on this song, rub a dub a dub dub, rub a dub a dub a dub 
Aladdin, no kidding boy I need a rub, rub a dub a dubdub, rub a dub a dub a dub 
Me and my speakers speakin sub a sub sub, sub a sub a sub a sub, sub a sub a sub a sub 
You know who I am I run this fuckin club, dub a dub a dub a dub, club a club a lub a lub 

Bass lines in as anything fast, humpin on my leg yo I'm on my fuckin glass 
Makin money last hide it in a flask, sound of a bomb blast throw it in tha bag 
Bass lines and cars anything fast, know who I am I run this fuckin club 
Speakers up throwin fire like a mob, thrash bang thunder throw me with some job 
MIA, you know who I am


Bass lines in as anything fast, humping on my leg yo I'm on my fuckin glass 
Makin money last, hide it in a flask, sound of a bomb blast throw it in tha bag 
I can kill a sound and the shit will make you jump, jum jum jum jum jum, jum jum jum jum jum jum 
I can smash a beat so the track will make you run, run run run run run run, run run run run run run 
I'm caught up to the tee, I tie up just for fun, fun fun fun fun fun fun, fun fun fun fun fun fun 
Get ready for the city street, weights by the ton, ton ton ton ton ton ton, ton ton ton ton ton ton 

Bass lines in as anything fast, humpin on my leg yo I'm on my fuckin glass 
Makin money last hide it in a flask, sound of a bomb blast throw it in tha bag 
MIA, MIA, MIA, MIA, A, A... 
You know who I am 
MIA, You know, You know who I am, A, A... 
MIA, Steppin up in this club, with my tool bag, rub adub, rub a dub a dub, rub a dub a dub dub 

I no, no one, no one no one, I no one, no no no one
