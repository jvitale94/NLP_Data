

M.I.A. on the mic
This is gonna be sick
If you're tryin' to talk to me
Then you better be fit (swagger)
Bad girl, Jamaican style
Don't want your pretty face in a smile
See Mia, Mia
If you ask how I'm doin', I'm fine
If you wanna know a bad girl come to good
Mothafucker I am tryin'
You know I'm packin' the heat
You better be ready for a crime
Breakin' order like a leader
I'm stayin' out the radar
Meet me at the border, border
Like Dora the Explorer
Holla, holla, holla
In a Corolla
When I drive in my borough
Cops still see my color (swagger)
They call me a ruler
On the way to the global future
I'm an Ivy League scholar
I'm here to shed light on the matter
We got that fuel and the venom
Better get ready for a banger
Eat my mum string hopper
Jump in the choppa
Chop up a mango
With my salt and pepper
Yeah I'm still a rider
Not white like the Oscar
I'm doin' it, I'm gonna love
Jesus was not a lot bitter

Pop, pop, pop, pop
Load 'em
Pop, pop, pop, pop
Load 'em and see
Pop, pop, pop, pop
Load 'em
Fly pirates, we can't stop
Pop, pop, pop, pop
Load 'em
Pop, pop, pop, pop
Load 'em and see
Pop, pop, pop, pop
Load 'em
Fly pirates, we can't stop

Swagger in the summer
So you better follow
Can't touch this, MC Hammer
I'm Michael Jackson, Thriller
Pop, pop, poppin' the collar
Turtleneck and a bomber
When I'm drivin' you know I'm a winner
Bamboo bangin', call me baby power
Throw up your henna
Throw up your middle finger
I'm a fighter and a lover
Competition of murder
Rider with a shotta
I set this track on fire
I'm here for every color
Including Black Lives Matter

Pop, pop, pop, pop
Load 'em
Pop, pop, pop, pop
Load 'em and see
Pop, pop, pop, pop
Load 'em
Fly pirates, we can't stop
Pop, pop, pop, pop
Load 'em
Pop, pop, pop, pop
Load 'em and see
Pop, pop, pop, pop
Load 'em
Fly pirates, we can't stop

Everybody in the place get lit
Throw your lighters in the air
Everybody in the place get lit
Throw your lighters in the air
Ayy, lay, lay, lay, l-lay, up in here
Gonna blow it up in here
Knock, knock, here's that bomb
Champion girl, show you where I'm from
Knock, knock, we stay strong
Show me someone I can't stand on
Ayy, lay, lay, lay, l-lay, up in here
Step it up, girl, up in here
When you get high with no visa
Everybody know it's M.I.A

Pop, pop, pop, pop
