I'm so tangy, people call me Matangi
Goddess of word, bitches I'm a keep it banging
Truth is like a rotten tooth, you gotta spit it out!
Let the bottom two, let my wisdom work it out
Big on the underground, can't knock me down
Vicki Leekx bitches, better buy it on demand
I Sleep in my tent and then I stand by it too
I can say lots with a little words or few like
Adam had 'em, yeh, me, the madame
I'll introduce you to the d-d-dem-dems
Come let me go, do you like my perfume?
Made it at home with some gasoline and shrooms
Oil and water are two extremes
We like fucking carpets, you like fucking brooms
Why is your tattoo some ugly looking thing?
I got many designs they're learning on Bing
My cousin got his DCS he's decorating
He's handy you might need him when I'm finishing what I'm saying
Just be frank, you my stan, understand!
I don't care what you smell what's you fucking joint
A lot to be pissed they're mates, and we're yanks
Cause it's not me and you, it's the fucking banks!

Bring the noise when we run upon them!
Bring the noise when we run upon them!
Bring the noise when we run upon them!
Bring the noise when we run upon them!

Dem-dem-dem-free-freekdom
Dem-dem-dem-free-freekdom
Free them, free them, free them, free them (freedom - freedom)

Truth is like a rotten tooth, you gotta spit it out 
Let the bottom two, let my wisdom work it out
The world is ours, sending your sordid powers
The words out now, hope you heard em like cows
A bikini body, worth a tally or a rich
Bitch, my swag rich, can't touch this
So click, click, click, please get off my dick
Just 'cause I'm a mom it don't make me thick
I'm a overweight, heavyweight, female Slick Rick
If you need the cheese then my shit cost stake
I got - a bug spray, bucket, stick
I got - tons of the fun stuff tons and tons of it

Bring the noise when we run upon them!
Bring the noise when we run upon them!
Bring the noise when we run upon them!
Bring the noise when we run upon them!
