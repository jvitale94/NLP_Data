Lights they bend and jump and always move really fast
Colors emerge light box had me in their grasp
We be rocking, we be rocking, rockin' in the car
Lights in sky goddess bumping the sitar


These lights yeah, These lights yeah
Green color, looking nice yeah
Turn it up too loud all the lights will turn red
If you upstairs you can hear it in the bed
Rainbows in my vision
Move into the rhythm
Electric shadows in my ears
Got me dancing spinning
Northern lights on my mind, all the colors rhyme
Loving me all the time keep that on your timeline


I keep my distance even though I shine
For me to tell you things, you need to be the right kind
Even though it's clear like a street sign
Some people don't get it so I keep 'em in line
It's good to take a minute and take it all in
It's so important sometimes that I blow off steam
Got to get another sweater from my helicopter
Got to get a closer look at what they all stick at

Doesn't need some lights that I used to trick out
I got them from a Chinese dude I went to check out
People need to get them, man, and put some in your pocket
You might need some later when you finally unlock it

 

Lights on ring cameras and things
Flashing like bling love, loving when I sing
Sparkles on the charcoal
As a fire lit up
Headlights off a power in the city lit up

All I wanna do
All I wanna do
All I wanna do
Is roll through the city, stargazing with you


Lights a selector
Original nutter

I used to be a bad girl, now I'm even better!
I don't keep no Beretta
I don't sell like a shotta
I don't often Twitter - they still see me as a threater
I'm counter to the counter, put your money on the counter
I'm standing at the counter, say "Hi" to my hunter
I did as freaking santa
I eat at Benihana!
I can make 'em feel good, I'm runnin' youth centers
I'm aiming for the center, sending light beams to sender
I think we can make it, now sip a little winner
