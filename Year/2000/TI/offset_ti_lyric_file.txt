I bet you diamond to dog shit you can't lost soon as I get strapped homie


You can't be riding foreign shit Off-set
Car ain't even out yet
Bit too long clip, you know you ain't 'bout that
Bankroll mafia, can't believe you bought that
Automatic long clip, you know you ain't 'bout that


Believe you heard what it said ho, nigga
Been known that I'm going before they say go, nigga
Try to cross the line, be a dead ho, nigga
Give a damn if you wearin' blue or red, ho nigga
Listen, I ain't really much for the convo
I'm finna bring the drama to your front door
R.I.P. Nando, shout out to Fernando
We gettin' keys til we here, andale pronto


Turn up out through the night
Fucking little mama right
Hey, black diamonds like a night
100k, I'm precise
No hater, I ain't throwin' rights
Hey, took what the fuck you say




Pussy nigga know a nigga spend it
Pussy nigga know a nigga ride with it
100 thousand, Chevelle
Nigga havin' hoes, hoes, hoes sounding ill (main bitch)
Nigga, I'mma keep it trill
I could never tell, I'mma make bail
Fuck, so many rats, I can't feel
Bet that Coca Cola take away some of the pills


Make play 
Still get money out the bitches
Every ho look away, catch whiplash
Still got the K in the whip stashed
Cut me wrong got your  dead
Bodybag, nigga you ain't gotta ask
You probably mad cause I hit and I came back
Hit it again, hit her friend
Then I'm in a win




Difference between me and you
Is you shoot and I aim for the body bag
I'm the same nigga that tell a lil bitch that they gon' have to show us that
You the same nigga that take pictures when trappers 
You'd rather fuck niggas so therefore I pop 'em off
Pop 'em off, pop 'em off
(The beef I just cooked and just turned into Stroganoff
Belly of the beat, hellraising that
Now I'm riding with a beauty with amazing hair
Kid round my house, say the king's in here
I'll make your head disappear like Malaysian Air)

(Hell nah Thugger, we gotta cut that shit out)
