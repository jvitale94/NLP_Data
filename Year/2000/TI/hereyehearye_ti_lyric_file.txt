


There's a rainbow everywhere depending on where you stand
Whether the dashboard a yay or the walls a hundred grand each
Double R interior tan, outside is peach
Oh you tryna make a deal out in golden beach
Or the Florida Keys ducking the Florida D’s
But you only end up with bricks and sand
I know niggas that run from their shadows like Peter Pan
Running like it’s a Nike commercial but he’s the man
What they don’t like on site he murk like he’s the clan
8 balls the size of baseballs like Jeter’s hand
It fecal fam’, yeah it’s the shit
Zip ya face up when skateboard is on the script
Catch me in the Gap V with some BBC trunks
Flip flops sipping on cream like its punch
I push the spaceship with the chrome lady in the front
Bending over like she just puffed Busta’s blunt
I told y’all muthafuckas once, I think I’m hungry
Finna eat ya’ll niggas lunch
Ya’ll niggas cunts, I’m from the commonwealth
Where wealth ain't common
When niggas roll around with chrome solvers looking for problems
Mouth full of gold, flame when they roll
Arthritic fingers niggas bang when they stroll
Trading in the hats for the cane and the gold
The golds for the chain and the cane was on swole
Ayo Tip get these pion niggas told


Still stand tall when it all falls down
Whether Hollywood hills or a one horse town
You should know better, there’s no better than these four letters
More than ever niggas want me dead
Cause they starving and I’m getting fed
But fuck ‘em anyway
I’d rather be me on my worst day than to be a sucka nigga on his birthday
All cake no candles, just a living example
Ten toes down all out no sandals
Godfather, a young Marlon Brando
Let me make sure they understand yo
Here ye, here ye, you wise you fear me
Real niggas on they shine, much obliged, merci!
Everybody wanna criticise him ’bout how bad he ended up
Look how bad he coulda been
I coulda caught a body sold a brick to somebody
Who volunteered my information to the federales
I made it outta all of that like I ain't gon be proud of that
So petty shit, you sticking to me, gimme all you got of that
Doing this for all my niggas
Who ’bout to go to prison and let a nigga kill ‘em
So we leaving this PO snub nose in his denim
Trap or death is waiting round the corners that he been in
On bended knee, God forgive us, we’ve been sinning
In our defence, look at the options we’ve been given
Laying in the prison cell staring at the ceiling
Back in this bitch again, I guess they weren’t bullshittin’ huh
Still wonder where it all went wrong
Since Phil got killed I ain't never moved on
Like I’m still in the club where the blows got thrown
When my crown fell down and I got dethroned
Bunch of niggas around but I feel all alone
Like a piece of me is missin’, guess it never came home
Probably died in a van when it all hit the fan
Save the life of a friend we don’t all get the chance
Now here I stand with blood on my hands trying hard to explain so hi’ mom understand
I done fought for the loss for the soul of a man
Only soldiers know how that’ll take a toll on a man
Burdens on the World of my shoulders: heavy
Visibly composed, my emotions buried
Scary, so if I pop a pill, smoke a blunt or take a shot
ya’ll let a niggga live
Still baffled how my life unravelled
In the meantime time just travelled
Can’t see behind the walls of my castle
Opinionated pions son but who asked you
I tell you what you do
Take ya two cents
Kick rocks to a fountain pitching to make a wish
Shit, if wishes had wings, they’d all make it to heaven
and we’d all be kings
If wishes had wings, they’d all make it to heaven
and we’d all be kings
Yeah
