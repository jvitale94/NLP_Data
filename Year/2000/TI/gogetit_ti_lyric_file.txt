Hustle won't quit
Shine like no other, I be on some other shit
I got a high price lifestyle super bad bitch
If I want it, bet I got it
If I don't bet all I gotta do is
Go, get it, stay about my bidness
Ball till I fall, floss until I finish
I just go get it, stay about my bidness
I'm living just to kill it, stack a million to the ceiling


Everyday above ground, all I wanna do is ball
Put my money over bitches, put my hustle over all
Louis  down to the drawers, Louboutin kicks
Got a mad hatter swagger, bitch I'm stupid dumb sick
With a group of young bitches and they stupid dumb thick
I'm the marathon man, all I do is run shit
A sophisticated convict, superficial, still official
Multimillion dollar shit
Money is the object, hot shit
Bitch I got a sauna on my arm
See bigger with no diamond
Recommend if I should run
They just talk about they got it,
I'm the upper echelon, though
Bitch I'm bout that action, you could go on with that convo
I have done more than you dream bout
Get your dream bitch and your dream house
On lean passing them beans out
With a bad crew, the whole team high
Go on boy, get seen about, bruh you know me, you know I be
Stacking that dough, that's all I see
I g.o.g.e.t.I.t.




I live life, up late night
Get shit faced when I take flight
I get paid, no sick days
My outfit's so switch blade
Don't sniff yay, but I blow dro
Bank roll on loco
Still ride with that 44
Don't let my P-O know
Bad white bitch super thick
I'm Ice T, she Coco
She got another bitch, other bitches
Her ass fat, face so-so, no paper triail
No phone call, no emails, no photos
Just backshot, with that fat butt
And low blow headbutts in slow-mo
Purple label polo and Akoo that's all I do
Man I strive and roll my denim in my new Margiella shoes
Man, we be cool if we just parle
On Margharita Molly and the strongest pack around
Bumpin Shawty in Maui
We menagin' for a hobby
We kick it how we kick it
Know you envy how I'm living
Just can't resist the pimpin
Get the million bout my business
Bruh you know me, you know I be
Stacking that dough that's all I see
I g.o.g.e.t.I.t.
