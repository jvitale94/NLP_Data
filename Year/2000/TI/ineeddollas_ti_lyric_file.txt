Well I need a dollar, dollar, dollar that's what I need (Hey hey)
Said I need a dollar, dollar, dollar that's what I need (Hey hey)
And I need a dollar, dollar, dollar that's what I need
And if I share with you my story would you share you dollar with me


You know what it is
Bitch still none other than the King
Need green just to occupy my rubberbands
Hundred grand at a time, keep it coming
When I started I was trapping
Woke up ballin like "what happened?"
It's gonna be hell to the captain
Let's just smoke up in this city
Let me get a 100 milli and focus on a billi
What's the muthafuckin dilly nigga? You already know
Profits at a steady flow, cheddar, paper, you already know
Stay a step ahead of whoever when niggas say he go
We never should've let him go to movies, television shows
And who we foolin? He ain't stupid
His bankroll just meet his ego
No less than seven zeroes, stimulate bitches libido
So crazy just like Danger Mouse and Cee-lo
From a kilo to a yacht in Cabo
Chillin like December in Toledo
He's so hungry for the money like he's still selling dimes
Got a mill on his mind, dollar bill at a time




Ain't no vacation, working like a Jamaican
Mixed with a Hatian
Several different occupations, no exaggeration
18-20 hour days while you sleeping I'm making money
Patient I ain't tracin' money, 'less the conversation money
What you saying dunny? Why you talking to me huh?
Hundred bound vs a quarter mill a show, a mill a movie
PRPS, Gucci, Louis, got my head as big as stewy
20 mills the answer if you ask mw how our crew are doing
Now I keep it moving, no exception, no conclusion
If we racing to the top, no competition, I'm a shoe-in
And you in my way, don't ruin my faith
'Fore I pay a 100K for them to boo you off stage
I'm way up front, stop playing, don't prank
Used to want dough like Jay-Z but now I'm thinking Donald Trump
Bob Johnson, Warren Buffett, fuck it, ain't that tough
Hundred mils stacked up, dollar bills add up
