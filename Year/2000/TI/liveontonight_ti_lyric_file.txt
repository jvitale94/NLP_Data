


I'm on the road the day I die
That unchangeable surprise
No waking up but don't you cry
Let your dreams live on tonight

Uuuuh Uuuuh
Uuuuh Uuuuh
Uuuuh Uuuuh
Live on tonight


Yea
Yea
Hustle Gang nigga!
Aye
Leggo!


We do it big, going hard, get it in
I tell make my hustle full fittin in
I'll catch a fair cake, go to prison then
Turn around, do the same shit again
Down back, countin rack
A hundred kilo champagne, hey I drown that
Loud pack, burnt up
Do the iMAX bid, shorty turnt up
The American dream, I'm livin in it
To Trayvon get some Jesses, I kill a bitch every minute
Yea talk, give a damn about the sentence
You ain't down to die for something
Your life ain't worth living


I'm on the road the day I die
That unchangeable surprise
No waking up but don't you cry
Let your dreams live on tonight

Uuuuh Uuuuh
Uuuuh Uuuuh
Uuuuh Uuuuh
Live on tonight


Yea
That right
Family Hustle nigga


I'm livin so my sons and daughters never see martyr
Get it, spend it today, save something tomorrow
A young king's Arthur, learned from my father
Tomorrow 50-50, today is our hour
Damn right, 24 hours, 365
Push it to the limit, switchin lanes on the highway
Like fuck it, if I diw today I die in pain
I'm straight nigga, straight bullets in your driveway
Man the game, man the game, why should I play?
For my fam, my life, damn alley
Put it on the line, never mind the consequences
You ain't down to die for something your life ain't worth living


I'm on the road the day I die
That unchangeable surprise
No waking up but don't you cry
Let your dreams live on tonight

Uuuuh Uuuuh
Uuuuh Uuuuh
Uuuuh Uuuuh
Live on tonight


Ahuh
I ain't finish, leggo


You know a trouble man ride with a hundred band
Bet it all, win or lose, it ain't nothing man
Modern day, near perfect, I'm the son of man
Every summer kill shit, call me Son of Sam
Big chain, big car
I could buy a big house on my black card
Them other suckers only wanna act hard
Hustle Gang, we jump off, flow stunt hard
So respected, I don't even need a bodyguard
But if it fully automatic then it probably hours
Real talk, give a fuck about the sentence
If you ain't down to die for something your life ain't worth living


I'm on the road the day I die
That unchangeable surprise
No waking up but don't you cry
Let your dreams live on tonight

Uuuuh Uuuuh
Uuuuh Uuuuh
Uuuuh Uuuuh
Live on tonight
