I got DOPE! BAP!
Grand Hustle nigga (Hustle Gang nigga!)
Yeah yeah yeah! Bap! (HEY! HEY!)
Get Dough Or Die nigga (broke niggaz eat your heart out!)
G.D.O.D. nigga (okay bruh)
AY! HEY!


Yeah, ay never mind that blahzay-blahzay, all we do is parlay
All we do is parlay, all we do is parlay
Ferrari Maserati riders, all we do is parlay
All we do is parlay, all we do is parlay
We livin every day like Friday, all we do is parlay
All we do is parlay, all we do is parlay
Just ask them hoes they know about us, all we do is parlay
All we do is parlay, say all we do is parlay


Got Maybachs on they block and a watch, tanktop, two chains
Snapbacks and cargos; them racks I got carloads
My flow sick, got parvo, my swag on retardo
A bunch of G's when we ride hoe, we live no Apollo
Got strippers, got star hoes, we talk shit, swallow spit
In mansions and condos, they quick to swallow dick
Fly G-4 to the West coast, under palm trees poppin Dom P
With a hazel-eyed big blonde weave that got a jungle booty, Jumanji
All I do is wake up, cake up, smear these bitches makeup
In them new Margiela flavors in Montego Bay, Jamaica
Hundred karat chain, solitaire, no Pavé
Never mind they blahzay-blahzay, all we do is parlay




Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ay thug, got me leanin to my left, fake as hell
I be saggin like a thug, buy a hoe the Louis belt
The whole clique, throwin ten, I can do that by myself
My sound ground, they be alien and don't know it like they live
I get my cash straight out K truck, nigga wanna try me
I'ma hit big cuz ASAP, he gon' drive the fever
Make it failin like it stay flake
Nigga we'll get you well-done, and stay away, the bumpin with my kayfabe
My house stay where the lake stay, Benz seat where my ass stay
I'm makin plays on a good day and only parlayin on a bad day
My Red Bottoms say CL, Benz coupe say CL
Sharp than they two hill, oops, now we three hills bitch!




Ay, all I do is parlay, I do everything the star way
I got bitches fuckin with me, pussy sweeter than a parfait
Sell all of my parquet at the other end of Parkway
Nigga try me and I'll make that chopper sing like a Bar-Kay
All I do is parlay, all I do is parlay
I been gettin money so I'm callin Target "Targét"
All of the bitches go our way, I'm killin these niggaz the bar way
You can't be a nigga they say is a dog unless they referrin to Shar-Peis
Me and that Gucci won't part ways, bitch I be fresh as a fool (fool)
These are the brooks in my forte, sometimes I be dressed in the cool (cool)
I know I be winnin cause suckers be constantly tryin to catch up with my mood (mood)
Sit back and watch while I turn up a notch, just  just what I do (do)
