I got a question for the ladies out there, yea
Cause there's a few things that I would like to know
Before I fuck with you

Oh baby
Could you learn?
Could you learn to love a trouble man? Yea eh
Oh baby
Could you learn?
Could you learn to love a trouble man? Yea

You sure you wanna roll with me? I'm a complicated man
Live my life close to the edge, it ain't even safe to stand
Trouble Man, always into something
Numb to the consequences, guess it's coming if it's coming
But so much shit they say that I can't do because I'm famous
Guess I should live in a bubble like these other entertainers
The danger's so enticing to me, I don't even notice it
Guess I get away or get arrested 'fore it's over with
Prison sentence every year, got everybody after me
Reaper on my heels, I'm just praying he don't catch a G
Imagine me and you, somewhere happy with a few hundred mills
Sill I could go to jail for some years
Cause I push it to the limit, the danger's so exciting
I'm loving every minute, girl this life ain't nothing like it
And you only live once so as long as I'm alive
I be living on the edge, shorty sure you wanna ride?

Oh baby
Could you learn?
Could you learn to love a trouble man? Yea eh
Oh baby
Could you learn?
Could you learn to love a trouble man? Yea

Ay ay ay
Aye, they say if the drugs ain't the death of me, the lifestyle will be
Law keep arresting me, sucka wanna kill me
Still we in the fast lane, grind break, next speed
A million dollar sports car, smoking on the best weed
Fist fights in night clubs for rap beefs
Shootings, retaliations, yes that deep
I guess they just got to catch me when they catch me
Because I'm putting it in they life if they attempt to disrespect me
Especially when I know they say what go around come around
That's why when we go around I keep a gun around
Cause bullshit, there be none around here
But I got a secret though, I wanna change â€“ I swear
But suckas won't let me and feds still sweat me
So I'm looking for the worst to have you praying for the best
Think you can help me if they get me? Could you handle shit for me?
Think about it, is your body shawty answer this for me

Oh baby
Could you learn?
Could you learn to love a trouble man? Yea eh
Oh baby
Could you learn?
Could you learn to love a trouble man? Yea

Girl would you give me your number? (tell the truth)
If I had an ok car, not much money
9 to 5, with a future on me oh
Tell me would you ever fuck with a brother like me? (would you?)
If I did time in my life, time in my life
Time in my life, time in my life
Tell me could you give your sex to me? (I really wanna know)
If I was fightin in the club, fightin in the club
Fightin in the club, fightin in the club

Hey baby!
Could you learn? (put your hands up)
Learn to love a trouble man
(If you got a drink I need you to put that in the air as well, ok?)
Hey baby
Could you learn?
Could you learn to love a trouble man? Yea eh
