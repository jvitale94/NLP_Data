Swinging through with something new, top down, riding clean
Top down, riding clean, top down, riding clean
Swinging through, swinging through
Top down, riding clean (in my city that's the way we ride)
Swinging through with something new, top down, riding clean
Swinging through with something new, top down, riding clean
(In my city that's the way we ride)
Top down, riding clean, top down, riding clean
Swinging through, swinging through
Top down, riding clean (in my city that's the way we ride)

Got my top down on my Bentley, I keep it pimpin the mo
2-85 I be hittin, even when there's nowhere to go
My wrists it hang out the window, my Rollie shinning and it shimmer
You see that bad bitch who with ya? If I want I can get er
Make her a activist sipper, a MDMA dipper
Make my suite presidential and then I fill it with strippers
Man I got chrome on my wheels, and your ho on my dick
Ride around, no roof on my whip, that's how you know I'm the shit
They know I'm rich, it don't matter
Bruh cause as fresh as I be
What she do for you you pay er
What she do for me for free
Cause I'm a G, still kick it with the trap nigga buyin things
Swinging through with something new, top down ridin clean



Aye clique, my old school is official, got them horses under my hood
Yea I'm ridin round in your side of town, and I'm blowin O's of that good
In the summer time I got to be
In the flyest ride, who higher than me?
They catch hell try to follow me
I bet Pimp C proud of me
I got the city lights in my rearview
We loud and can't hear you
Got a billion on my music, could be closer then in the future
Blowing big, stacks, all we do is that
Valet my shit is fair, fuck up a check and sack
Then it's back to the job, hit the gas, burn a gas
Got my double cup filled up, pint of lean sealed up
Brawds looking for me all day, whenever I'm seen
Swinging through with something new, top down riding clean



Ride 40 mill, you see 8 R's nigga
Try me bitch, you see AR's nigga
Got purple stuff in my 20 ounce
I got bubble kush in my cigar nigga
Pull string, no guitar, put down, roll the dice what they hit for
I don't know if this is yo bitch
She on my dick, you better come get her
Don't want me on yo street with this clean paint and these white seats
She's gonna be inside here and you have no idea
How she be tryina get up in the whip whenever I'm seen
Rolling through with something new, top down ridin clean
