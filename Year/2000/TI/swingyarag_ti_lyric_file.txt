New Akoo outfit with a Gucci rag
Tied to my belt loop and my Louis bag
Full of stacks rubberbands round big cash
Got a sick swag tell the haters get mad, comeon

Bottles of Patron if you grown get your buzz on

Falling on my Louis shoes, shirt match my Louis rag

I Say, "Whoa kimosabe!", big balling is my hobby
I'm boppin while I'm walking, rag falling out my pocket
If big money ain't the topic, homie I ain't even talking
Hated on by the workers but I'm cool with all the bosses
Catch me flossing at the mall (mall), talking to a broad (broad)
She follow me in Gucci and I taught her how to ball
Three pair of shoes, four shirts, six rags
The chick said, "Dag, that's more than my bag!"
Shawty I can show you how to spend this bread real fast
Then get a group of chicks to give you head real fast
Silk scarf hanging out of my jeans
Naw homie, I ain't thinkin I'm just doing my thing!

And when this song on, ballers peel stacks off
And make it rain on them broads, watch them stacks fall

Ride Bankhead flare flying out the Benz
Once a fool with it we 'gon bring 'em out again
