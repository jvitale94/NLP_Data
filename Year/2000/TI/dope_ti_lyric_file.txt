With burners on us
C
Berkin duffle a hundred thousand in it
Aye nigga rollow up
Anyway Dusse with lemonade
Feeling good
Like I am dealing ye
Moving ten a day

Could do this shit forever
Can't even put it in words
How I am in love with her
From slinging
Hustling drugs with her
The jet mine 50 million
A wonderful feeling
Shit, I'm high as a motherfucker
I'm high as a motherfucker
Don't ask me shit, make me lie to you motherfucker
Man truth is for real, feel like Dream for real
Mixed with Eric B. and Rakim, shawty hell on the scale
And still the game enticing me like every time I see her
They like to pop a seal, high enough to see Aaliyah
For real, and man, I know how artist's chill
You don't know how good it make a nigga feel


I'm coming down
High as a motherfucker
High as a motherfucker
Boy you get me
High as a motherfucker
High as a motherfucker


This winter shit got me high as a bitch
Dripping sauce kicking flavor
Super fly with the shit

I promised Dre
I would put the game on lock
Ain't no taking that shit back
Put it on everything I got
Got damn
Aventador, hopping out the Lamb

Mam tell your son he better watch it
Cause we roll
And disrespect is not an option
In my neighborhood
So watch how you talking to me
Even if we know you hating
Then that is all it can be

Find you ass OD'd
Dead ass can be


I'm coming down
High as a motherfucker
High as a motherfucker
Boy you get me
High as a motherfucker
High as a motherfucker
