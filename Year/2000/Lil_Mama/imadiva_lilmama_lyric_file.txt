Can't you hear the way I talk?
I'm sorry,

I just look like this; I just look like this,
Did you hardly (really) catch my catwalk?
Because I'm a diva, (I'm a) diva, diva, (I'm a) diva,
I'm a diva, (I'm a) diva, diva, (I'm a) diva,
I was born like this; I was born for this,
It's the way I'm a diva-diva!

In my shadow, does my sassiness upset you?
