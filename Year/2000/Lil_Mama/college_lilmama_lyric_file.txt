


Now that I think about it
I was always takin away from my father
Or he was always takin away from me
It's probably why we so close now
Ya kno


We been starvin so long in these crazy ghetto streets
And they say we're so wrong for the way we try to eat
How long will he struggle
I gotta grind jus to eat now
I gotta eat jus a lil now
So I gotta live my life this way


I stretched and yawned
4 years from a newborn
On a charter bus
Filled with stranged humans
Besides my mother nobody seems anxious
Though we on our way to visit a college campus
We roll up freshen up at a food concession
Can't talk to strangers
I wanna ask em questions
Saw a woman cryin
Boy face the fence
I don't wanna go to college
If it causes this
Back on the bus still analyzin vibes
Turned to my moms excel asked her
'why you cryin? '
She said because I'm happy
But I could tell she lyin
And since lyin was a curse
I sense storytellin
Her eyes focused on a object long enough they tingle
That's when she reached into her bag because her phone was ringin
She said 'I accept'
I'm still puzzle piecin
I knew my pops was on the other line
Lonely singin




Soon after we roll up to these gates
Barbed wired up
Men standin in the entrance armed up
With a close eye on us
We enter the buildin
Got checked by the women who starin
My mother
Pull out a card with a picture of her face on it
Two papers with our names on it
They identify her
They lookin at me
Me my confusion of the journey
Thorugh these walls we go
Before the next one opens
The past one must close
As they check for proper clothes
My mama so prepared
For this mini battle has chose
Finally we reach our final destination
My poppa placed in a seat
Facin me
No women in his class
Jus men who never laugh
And when they see they family
They sing




So I begin my investigation
My elbow on the round table
My palm at chin
I'm lookin at him
Ask questions like
'how you been? '
'when you graduatin? '
Time was up got pulled away
Kickin and screamin
Tears came to his eyes
But never fell in front me
Got old enough to realize
Must've fell up under me
Bein locked away in prison from your family
Tryin to find ways for us to eat
I see
