I do it 
Do it
All night I make'em say
Oh 
Gimme some more
I do it all night

My whip is all white
I don't have a couple drinks & I got a 'lil buzz so I'm feelin

Alright
But the night is just getting started
Haters get disregarded
Roll up them sweet creep creep
Let's hit this street and get retarded
I pop a bunch of bottles
My bitch would be poppin' too
Keep talkin out your face,
She might be poppin you
She might be pop blockin' droppin down to the floor with it
Meanwhile all my dogs chasing paper thats right we go get it
So get it right
Kill the lights
I'm feelin' like I might just pop a pill tonight
'Cause the feelin's right
Pass me a Miller Light
Shen grab that girl with that Coke bottle shape
She's my type
I take her home and do the do
I know the Kamasutra think what I do to you
Stick to you like superglue maybe even like a buble gum
Don't sleep woman no matter how many times I come

I do it all night 
I do it 
Do it
All night I make'em say
Oh 
Gimme some more



I do it all night 
I do it 
Do it
All night I make'em cash
Oh 
Gimme some more

I do it all night
And I ride'em long pads
Maybe little crib could ask I'm gonna ask his shortie what that mouth

Had
Tell me if he's out of sight
Tell me if he's slow and long
Maybe ladies do give his turn get bub maybe you're wrong
But I'm really gonna show you right
Tell me where you wanna go tonight
Anywhere anyplace I can see in your face you are the prototype
Tellin'em like I'm so so hot
So so feelin' like I'm so so right
Please tell me why the jokes on fire I can't stop zoning & I don't

Know why
Beep Beep
Get about my land
Ya hoes can't do it like me
If ya thinkin I'm 'bout the game
Take a look at my U.N.I.T
This is why I'm black on deck but don't get it twisted but strap on

Deck
The mad on deck the pack on deck
And down there they keep a rack on deck
And there's no chairs there's no we there's no hoover & there's no me
There's they would dem mass MC and there's messin'dem caddie and

There's on three
No matter they say I'm gettin my break
Gettin' my paper
Get my cheque
But anybody wanna try to ass up
And gettin some heat


How many woman can I feed up in my caddillac
So how I can see feelin' like I got cataract
Some in the middle with ice say I get drunk
And don't know how to act
I don't know how to act


He don't know how to act
And I don't know how to stop
And I don't know how to quit
Blowin' on in the trouble zone
Now we need another field
And I mean up out my man
Now I mean up out my body
So have do this all night
'Cause you're comin' with me shorty
