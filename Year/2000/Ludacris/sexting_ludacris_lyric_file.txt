Trying to get myself unhooked on ass
So then my teacher asked me a question
Like Ludacris are you over there sexting
Ha ha OMG lol KIT Smiley faces X and O's LMFAO
My girl went through my cell phone
My girl went through my cell phone
My girl went through my cell phone
My girl went through my cell phone
I said my girl went through my cell phone



So I'm getting treated for my sex addiction
In a private clinic and I need you to be sensitive about my condition
Cause I'm in it to win it and I really don't want to further disappoint my fans
And my teachers a cougar so I wish she'd lend a helping hand
Damn, calm down, BBC TXT or MSG
After class come with me and can I get a little bit of TLC
She replied what the f-ck
FYI you're gonna flunk
SMH it's such a shame
You ain't learned a damn thing




So I'm sitting in the crib just chillin and I'm minding my business
Got a text with a tongue out from a number I didn't recognize
I replied who is this
Quick back got a hit back
Said this is Stacy and I've been missing you
Had to change my number so I went and got a new phone and new tattoo
A what, a new tattoo wow,
Arrr yeaah, hurry click
Can you send a nasty pic
So I can see right where it is
and I promise I won't show my friends (yeah right)
She replied, well ok BTW by the way
SMH it's such a shame that you ain't learned a damn thing




So I pull up to the club stunting in a Yellow Lamborghini
Half bent, black tint, fine pussy make it a little hard to see me
Stepped out, fresh out headed straight for the door and to the VIP
Next thing I got a text from a freaky Latina saying is that you I see
Is that you papi
So I bbm'ed abbreviate yep and before the night gets too late
Let me hit you with a little Q&A
Can I tap that ass tta
She replied it all depends
It's me plus one can I bring my friends
And all I can think was that it's such a shame
That I ain't learned a damn thing
