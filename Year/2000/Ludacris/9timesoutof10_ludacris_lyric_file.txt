At the strip club playin' Eenie Meenie Miney Mo
Walk in side the booty club, I'm pickin' any one I want
9 times out of 10 I'm probably fuckin' with some hoes


9 time out of 10 I'm probably fuckin' with some hoes
At the strip club playing Eenie Meenie Miney Mo
Walk in side the booty club, I'm pickin' any one I want
9 times out of 10 I'm probably fucking with some hoes
Eenie Meenie Miney Mo, Eenie Meenie Miney Mo
Eenie Meenie Miney Mo, Eenie Meenie Miney Mo
Eenie Meenie Miney Mo, Eenie Meenie Miney Mo
Eenie Meenie Miney Mo, Eenie Meenie Miney Mo


Luda!
50 thousand hangin' from my earlobe
With a bank account that most niggas would kill for
Stupid retarded crib, and all my whips clean
Rockin' some Jays that don't come out til 2015
I'm moonwalking bitch,
Yeah, I'm Michael Jackson thriller fresh
Slipped inside the mirror, saw a pimp nigga in the flesh
Spray some Polo cologne, to match my Polo socks
Now Coke bottle bitches, make your soda pop
And drop it like I ain't ever seen you drop it before ho
Drop it for a legend or this DTP logo
Drop it for a little free marketing and promo
And let me Instagram this photo




Scrolling through my Ho-lledex
Eenie Meenie Miney Mo, let's see what ho is next
So many to choose from, I can't make up my mind
But whoever I pick better get up on the dick
Real quick, don't waste my time
Cause I got shit to do, so I'm just bout to smash
Soon as I'm through with you, back to countin' this cash
I'm hung low to all these women, I'm their antidote
And when they on my dick look like they riding a banana boat
But on they period, I don't want them mislead
So it's a sign by my bed that say "No turn on red"
Treating women like spades, I'm so unstoppable
Just tying to leave the club with 'bout 3 and I'm possible




Coke Boys in the house, that cost a house
Disturbing the peace, smoking that loud
Throw up 50 like nothin'
Cause bitch I'm worth 20 Ms
Brick throwing got your bitch jumping like Sean Penn
Got a neck full of gold, fresh out the 'lympics
Stack never fold, pussy clap on the pole
Louis tax counting mills, Louis on that field
Coming fresh out the corner, now he on that hill
With your bitch blowing smoke nigga
I ain't gang banging, but Luda that's my folk nigga
9 times out of ten, house money I spend
Take your bitch and her friends
