

She said her name was Lisa Marie
And she was a beast
Woman so bad it’s illegal to speak
She say she like me and she was eager to meet
And I was just as eager as eager as she
Body so sick you can eat off her feet
Go to the hospital die in a week
She say she was a model well obviously
‘Cause I can sure picture her between my sheets
Baby was a flower with rose petal cheeks
And every time she talk was like a gold medal speech
Intelligent she should teach
And if so I would be a nerd like Screech


I told her I would write a rhyme about her, and it would be sweet 
I said I need the perfect track, she said that’s deep
Worked on it all night didn’t get no sleep
Now here is my song and this is the beat
This is the beat this this is the beat and here is my song about Lisa Marie
She she she said her name was
Lisa Marie
Li-Lisa Marie
Li-Lisa Marie
Li-Lisa Marie
Li-Lisa Marie
Li-Lisa Marie
Li-Lisa Marie
Li-Lisa Marie
Li-Lisa Marie

She said her name was Lisa Marie
And she was discreet
Her picture's in the dictionary next to elite
I told her we could get away we can retreat
Cut off my arms put ‘em on her seat
Cut off my legs put ‘em on her head
So I can run through her mind like she does mine
And every time she smile it make me feel like a child
In the supermarket on the candy aisle
I saw a picture of her with her panties down
I fall asleep and dream I’m a camera now
I would love to be the water in her shower 
Or one of her bath towels



She said her name was Lisa Marie
And she was a piece
A piece of fine art like a piece of the leak
She was unique exquisite
Like xyz she was complete
And I think she like butterflies 
Because she got one on her upper thigh
And her face is like summertime 
Birthday the same month of mine
With a different sign
Virgo I go where ever her go
If she say so I’m on her like a fur coat
In November she colder than December
She got me falling like timber
