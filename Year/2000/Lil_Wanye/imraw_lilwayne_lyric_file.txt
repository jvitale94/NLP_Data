Flow sick, put a straight jacket on my words 
So sick, they think that something's in the herb 
They think I'm gone, but I'm fine like a woman's curves 
My personality is far from your reality, I'm closer to your girl, 
Now come on ho don't embarrass me! There is no comparising 
This right here be kerosene, carousel, parasail, I'm higher than everything 
When I spit u cant drink it like your 17 
I can show a million pair of eyes that they've never seen, 
And I can do this in whatever the weather brings 
Picasso couldn't paint a better scene, colossal 
Now give me the mike and I'll rock like a fuckin fossil 
I'm mad at the track, and I'll beat it like Hector Commadule 
What's poppin, what it do, what's happenin, what's crackin, que pasa 
The hospital, mi casa su casa, 
Bad, I'm rad, and these niggas just squares like plaid, and if they're cool,
Then I'm cold, I gets money all day like the toll bitch 


Im raw 
I got my brim low, all I can see is the floor 
Im raw 
Im bout to I'm bout to murder this shit 

I'm a BET soldier, an MTV gangsta 
I will be on VH1 when I'm done being famous 
Explain shit, I have made my way 
And you are just a stain bitch you will fade away 
And I only leave my house to paper chase 
Yep, off to da jungle, where I feel safe 
Like a homerun in the bottom of the 9th inning 
And I'm fresh like I'm by Minin haa 
I'm on the clock like 5 minutes, 
Tryna get passed the line of scrimmage, yeah... 
And before I leave her thighs bendin
She give me face first like she done dived in it, hahaha 
And if she tall I can climb in it 
I usually dont have a time limit 
And eating pussy aint a crime is it 
If so, I should start working on my jail visits 
You know... 
I'm in the game they just sell tickets 
Man I got old bread like stale biscuits 
You feeling froggy all you gotta do is yell ribbit 
Turn ya ass to a statue like an exhibit 
Now lets get it, let me at 'em 
Leave my cage open 
With no pyro I leave the stage smokin 
Yes, it's Weezy F. bitch 
The best thing since breath bitch 
Suffocate 


Im raw 
I got my brim low all I can see is the floor 
Im raw 
Im bout to, I'm bout to murder this shit 

It go uptown, uptown operation shut down 
Wake up to polices, go to sleep to the gun sounds 
And your not a gorilla, your a dead monkey 
Cuz I got a banana clip in these Red Monkeys 
What you said, don't be afraid to say it twice 
And they say life is cheap, until you pay the price 
It's just like shaking dice, but I hope you roll a winner 
And if you are rat, your're just a cobra's dinner 
Yall aint fuckin with me, you niggas under a G, 
Like the light part of my feet 
And so what them niggas left me 
When they get cold I turns into Wayne Gretsky 
G to the N, I do's it like it's never been done, 
So you can suck my dick with an elephants tounge 
Bitch 
It's weezy baby 
Mutha fucka I spit rabies
