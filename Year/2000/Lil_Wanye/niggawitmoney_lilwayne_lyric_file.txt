I'ma nigga wit money
And I don't love dat bitch


Yea, backpack full of stacks all the bitches love me
Don't compare to these rappers I'm on a diff'rent budget
I ain't even gotta practice never gettin rusty
No I ain't lookin down but I see no one above me
The paper bag brown wit durty green money
The bank acount good full of clean money
Fuck chain money

Stop playing wit me stop playin wit me bitch
Stop playing wit me stop playing wit me bitch
I'ma cash money stunna on my 14 summa
Dick a bitch down n take erry thang from er
Now run to the kitchen I ain't hungry I ate
Bitch put 36 o's on my plate
See my paw wuz cookin slabs while my mom wuz cookin dinner
See my momma iz a chef n my daddy wuz a dealer
Grand daddy was a dealer and my auntie is a killer
I hope she kno I luv her, pray the pigs never get er
My brother still a baby n my uncle kinda raised me
Yaw pray for his wife cause dat cancer shit iz crazy
My daughters so smart that it scares me
Her mother is an angel she's always there for me
And me I'm just wild I think I need therapy
Because I'm goin after dat money no matter where it be
