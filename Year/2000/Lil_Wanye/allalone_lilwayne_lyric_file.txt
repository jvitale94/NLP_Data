I wake up in the morning.
Take a knee and thank God.
Then go to the mirror, look myself in the eye.
Today I didn't wake up with a woman on my side.
Yesterday I didn't wake up with a woman on my side.
Neither the day before that, nor before that.
I just remember the moments call me Kodak.
And know that I do miss yah, but
It's your denial that I must hold against yah.
Since you've, I've been all alone
But alone is steroids, so you made me strong.
Girl hair, gone in the wind.
You cheated on God's
Son, baby girl that's a sin.
But I forgive you, but
I can't give you.
Another chance ma you in my rear view.
And I put that ring on yo finger.
I was all in
Now it's just a symbol of what could've been, God Damn!


And know I'm by myself but (I like it)
Damn she left me all off by myself but, (I like it)


Yo, I love my niggas.
No homo.
I swear I hope all get cheese like Digiorno.
It's somethin bout that Hot Boyz that you don't know.
I gotta love for em' that I don't show
And B.G. been my nigga since the front door.
I hope Chopper City
Records blow fa show.
And me and Juve never really got along.
But you still would let yo nigga come get on yo hottest song.
Damn, I fucked with ya fa that.
I fucked with ya Lil Wack and me and skip go back.
When you see a real nigga, you gotta tip yo hat.
And since I'm a real nigga
I do just that.
I had my own lawyer working on Turk's case.
After I heard em dissin me on the mixtape.
Cause he's locked up and I'm free
He got a lot more to worry then me, I ain't trippin.



Yah niggas left me by myself but I can't front (I like it)
And so now I become the President of the spot yah left me at.
A lot has change but I can't font (I like it)
