Megahertz y'all

Another day in the life
Speaking for all thug moneys
Paper chase themselves for us
They man love money

Schemin' ass honey tryna get my shine
Such a lady of grace with such a hood frame of mind
Summertime's here, dazzy dukes are in order
Swingin' with my cousin a lil' thicker, a lil' shorter

Five in the whip, we like to flow thick
CD's in the clip, let's take a road trip
Hey what we gon' do now? Cop some trees
Take a ride in the range through the block and skeeze
We conceded asses, waving to the masses

Cats doing wheelies on their bikes flyin' past us
Head to the mall or maybe the ville
Steady cruisin' down Fifth, do lunch at Negril
Stores closin', down goes the sun
Everybody get ready for the real fun

(A-ooh)
Yeah, y'all you know it's goin' down
Jumpin' in the whip and we rollin' around town
Wildin' out until you're layin' all on the ground
More heat and there's plenty to go around

(Just bounce)
Party people come shake it over here
(Just bounce)
Got you throwin' your hands all in the air

(Just bounce)
Everybody go shake it over there
(Just bounce)
Blowin' the spot up like we don't care
(A-ooh)

Now we done huffed a lot of ounce up
Orangina, my cousin flirtin' with the bouncer
Seconds rounds on me, D-I-G, the third is yours
Time to mop the dance floor

See we ain't paying so debt that duke
Cali's club be the shit so they close at two
I'm a socializer, y'all know my steeze
Whether loungin' at Spy Bar or grindin' at Speed

Now you might see me dolo or with a bunch of dimes
Or ridin' shotgun when I'm jottin' punch lines
Or maybe with the squad
Rollin' BK style, first lady profile
No more chicks allowed

Say what we gon' do now?
Load the set, take a ride down to Philly
Check where's that Moet?
Or back to the bricks have drinks at my apartment
I'm the real ghetto superstar

(A-ooh)
Yeah, y'all you know it's goin' down
Jumpin' in the whip and we rollin' around town
Wildin' out until you're layin' all on the ground
More heat and there's plenty to go around

(Just bounce)
Party people come shake it over here
(Just bounce)
Got you throwin' your hands all in the air

(Just bounce)
Everybody go shake it over there
(Just bounce)
Blowin' the spot up like we don't care
(A-ooh)

We bring the night to a close
Downed a couple shots and we threw a couple bows
What we gon' do now? Take it down? Nope
After hours on the other side of town

Come on swing with me if you're able
Corner reserved and they got a pool table
The music jumpin' better than the club
Champagne on the house and the DJ show love

But all good things must come to end
Headed back to the whip time to parkin' lot pimp
Just when you thought it couldn't get no thicker
Shorty gotta hurl, said she can't hold liquor

Who gettin' dropped off first? Please
Time to roll another L, hot cakes at Mickey D's
Peace, peace y'all, here's one for the roll
Hit me later on the jack for the next episode

(A-ooh)
Yeah, y'all you know it's goin' down
Jumpin' in the whip and we rollin' around town
Wildin' out until you're layin' all on the ground
More heat and there's plenty to go around

(Just bounce)
Party people come shake it over here
(Just bounce)
Got you throwin' your hands all in the air

(Just bounce)
Everybody go shake it over there
(Just bounce)
Blowin' the spot up like we don't care
(A-ooh)

(A-ooh)
Yeah, y'all you know it's goin' down
Jumpin' in the whip and we rollin' around town
Wildin' out until you're layin' all on the ground
More heat and there's plenty to go around

(Just bounce)
Party people come shake it over here
(Just bounce)
Got you throwin' your hands all in the air

(Just bounce)
Everybody go shake it over there
(Just bounce)
Blowin' the spot up like we don't care
(A-ooh)
