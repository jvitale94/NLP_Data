Yo, yo, yo, yo, everybody
Everybody, everybody

Now, tell everybody how you came up with your name
What was it like try'na get up in the game
Dirty Harriet's the name saying anything goes
Acting like you never seen a tomboy in dress clothes

Like you run around splurging deepen the excursion
TV people pissed 'cause I spit the dirty version
Now, tell everybody what be going through your mind
Up on the stage when you 'bout to bust a rhyme

Seein' people on my left, seein' people on my right
Every now and them you come across a fucked up mic
Make sure they got water, stay steady with the light
And I rock it so tight, make the bitches start a fight

Now, tell everybody 'bout niggas in your camp
How we be rolling when we work and we lam
Got Rock Sham Bus Ramp Spliff me six
And another set of caps double that in the Bricks

Some smoke, some drink, some battle just for kicks
Some'll give your ass a Duffy just for try'na take flicks
Now, tell everybody what be going through your brains
Celeb chick up in the rap game

Smoke a rogie in a store getting tipsy on a plane
Take a whole lot of money, fuck around and ride the train
Say my voice too maley, can't understand me
No album out super bitch won a Grammy

All the ladies in the place
Clap your hands
All the fellas in the house
Clap your hands
Everybody

Say, come on, bounce, come on, bounce

Now tell everybody 'bout niggas on your block
In New Jerus where the crime don't stop
See a bunch of little niggas wearing scuffed up Tim's
If his stash been tapped it was probably Juanes Mins

Some like to shoot dice, fuck around lose friends
Some'll blow your brains out get you for your rims
Now, tell everybody 'bout bitches 'round the way
Who like to hustle, lose scams everyday

Type of chicks hit first, even let they kids curse
Get a check every month, day job as a nurse
I'm bumping out the crib playing scratch card numbers
So I'ma get slick, evict they own man running

Now, tell everybody how we dipping in the stash
Or with the swerve don't be spending no cash
Drinking all type of goodies, sending heads on a run
Every time I pass a L, here comes another one

Now bitch got the munchies, making heads front me
Dipping in the drom niggas fuck around and jump me
Now, tell everybody how we keep it on lock
Now, where we headed when the block get hot

Now, we speeding on the Ave., puffing on lots of ganjas
Pumping Jay shit, somebody got Nostradamus
Kicking one-liners, car full of rhymers
Dipping down the block when the cops get behind us

Now, tell everybody where you heard it all first
Type of shit going into Digga verse
Say intellect punch lines, kill 'em all one time
Voice still crazy even when I kick my fun rhymes
Digga supreme clientÃ¨le like ghost faces
Niggas have to go rewrite in most cases

All the ladies in the place
Clap your hands
All the fellas in the house
Clap your hands
