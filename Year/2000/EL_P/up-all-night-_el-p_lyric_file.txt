I'm from Brooklyn, vandals bedrocks
Scandal bedlam, broken burnt up
New New York speed, new speed, true speed
Universe dirt, birds of loose leaf

Form the casbah, bring the bleeders
Sanity fist fucks, such allegiance
Born a trash maid, grew in garbage
Mutant hostage, do the knowledge

I see you all regardless
I know what lies are like
I might've been born yesterday, sir
But I stayed up all night

I see you all regardless
I know these times are fright
We might've been born yesterday, friends
But we stayed up all night, right

I'm a young man, I'm unhappy
We deserve that, dream collapsin'
I'm just one man, so damn angry
Truth confusion, scared with truthers

Hide your foil, hide your face
Say hi horsemen, higher stakes
Hi again, well, how about that?
Well, how the fuck else can I react?

I see you all regardless
I know what lies are like
I might've been born yesterday, sir
But I stayed up all night

I see you all regardless
I know these times are fright
We might've been born yesterday, friends
But we stayed up all night, right

Hell you're too preachy, you don't reach me
Right and wrong's flawed, you say easy?
Okay maybe, I was normal
On some rap shit, up raw backspin

Paws collapsin', back to windmill
Innocent thrill, some old-fashioned
Moral D-Ray, I'm no different
I wish my whole still existence

From the blades, necissate shit
Lifespan program, final digits
You're my daddy, you'll protect me
I need guidance to live correctly

I can't fight you, fear of the ether
I'm the servant, you're the teacher
What the fuck man? Oh, so sorry
That's the implant talking for me

I see you all regardless
I know what lies are like
I might've been born yesterday, sir
But I stayed up all night

I see you all regardless
I know these times are fright
We might've been born yesterday, friends
But we stayed up all night, right
