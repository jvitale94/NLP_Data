Hold that position while I...
The other games you played are over for you now I promise
There's nothing coy allowed within these walls, nothing less than honest
Please sign this document attesting voluntary process

I'll restrain you for your protection now do I have your consent for this? yes
Funny how an hour ago you were lying
You wanted to come clean to me the moment we met is that also correct? yes

You've been sitting on a secret literally

Weve got our ways to make you speak
Weve got our ways to make you talk [x2]

Tell me what I want to hear [x4]
