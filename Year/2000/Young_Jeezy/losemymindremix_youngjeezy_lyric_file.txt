Oh this dat shit right here
Wassup wassup
(103)oh!
(nigga 103)oh!
Dey gon get crunk when dis shit drop in the club nigga
Let's go!


Why ya'll trippin, I'm just fine
12:45, about dat time
Could'nt get it all week, time to unwind
Drank Like a tank, blew my mind

This shit crazy, way too bad
Rosetti baby, waste 2 stacks
Hottest thing in the lot, that there mine
Can't spell sober, lost my mind


I'm hearin voices in my head think I'm schitzophrenic
I swear they sayin let's get it from anotha planet
36 a thousand times I'm doin summersaults
Do it right and you can leave ya whole summer off
I'm out my mind, yea a nigga seein double ya'll
Now tell me watz the chance of jizzle fuckin both of ya'll
She said as long as we can do it with ya ice on
If that's the case we might as well leave the lights on
I'm out my mind, just blew a thousand swisher sweets
In my black and orange charger, call it trick or treat
It ain't nothin to a boss, my goons got goons
How stupid dumb big, my rooms got rooms




Do I love these hoes, mmm, kinda sorta
I got em drinking Sangria like it's fucking water
Some Miami women, tan lines showing
And they really bout' whatever shit is mind blowing
Fuck what they talk, do what I say
Bust it open girl, and send it my way
You say you like it like that I think I like it too
Half a million in a week it's only right I do
All seeing eye, my eyes seen it all
I talk a lot a shit, I swear I mean it all
103, and 4 figures to the hater tryna front on me, aghhh




Drop the top, no bra, got da titties out
Mention my name and bring da whole city out
Doing what I do best, d-boy stuntin
New car, old money, d-boy stuntin
Step in cleaner then a new glock-40
Nickname in the A strapped up shawty
You know my nerves bad, trigger like a toothepick
Line wrapped around the corner boy too big
G-Code, black shades and my black chains
But if you wouldn't understand, it's a black thing
You know we drink that Rose til we black out
Wake up, drink some more, pass back out
