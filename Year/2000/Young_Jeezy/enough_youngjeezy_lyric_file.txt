If you grind long enough
If you grind hard enough


Oh Lord, I woke up this morning and started praying
And only niggas feeling my pain, know what I'm saying
Dear Lord, street life ain't no game, know what I'm saying
It's for my money really, fuck the fame and I ain't playing
See I passed the rock a couple of times, let me assist
Nigga me and ya'll together how the fuck we gone miss
Nigga all we worry about is how the fuck they gone flip
Come thru in dem drop things, I swear to god they gone trip
Beat the haters, Beat the feds, now that's gotta be a sign
Smoke da blunt and left the body, Right and loose my mind
Hit the booth and spazzed out, almost lost my mothafuckin' mind
Might fuck these hoes, get on my mothafuckin' grind
Sleep is the cousin of death and I'm alive
Thug Motivation plus inspiration equals survive
They tryna rob you for ya success with no disguise
I know that shit was hard on you Young and where ya ride


(If you grind hard enough)
You could stack a few mil' nigga make it out the streets like me
(If you grind strong enough)
You could be a trap star nigga be on TV and keep it G
(If you grind long enough)
You could take care of your nephews and your nieces and your moms and your girl
(If you grind hard enough)
You could stand on top, tell these hatin ass niggas It's Tha World


I'm on deck, on point, I'm straight, I'm cool
Dropped the whole 500, drop dat old school
Live by the G Code nigga, I don't break no rules
Hey, when I was in the streets I ain't see those dudes
All I know, come through use the kitchen do the dishes
Block hot say ya prayers say ya mothafuckin' wishes
Jizzle what you do? you sick of hopping outta a Coupe?
Cop a four door nigga hop up out it in a suit
Giorgio Armani, still represent the struggle
I'm in this Giorgio Armani, still represent the hustle
See the man made the clothes, clothes never made the man
And if a nigga tell you different, he ain't seen a hundred grand
All I heard is what I couldn't do, All I heard is what I couldn't be
Yet I'm still determined on these niggas, just look at me
Sometimes I lay up in my bed, think 'till my head hurt
Fuck rest I rather stress, yeah we call that bad work




Okay now fuck that bullshit, get off ya mothafuckin' ass
You working with us
Yup, you grind a mothafuckin' a half
And when you grind a half 
You pay ya mothafuckin' staff
And then u take the hood 
You do the mothafuckin' math
Now fuck that bullshit, get off ya mothafuckin' ass
Get off ya fucking ass 
Nigga stack ya fuckin cash 
And when you grab ya 
You pay ya mothafuckin' staff
And then u paid the world
You do the mothafuckin' math
