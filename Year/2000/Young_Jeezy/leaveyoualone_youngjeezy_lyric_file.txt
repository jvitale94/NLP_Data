She said you ain't no good but you feel so good
She said I would if I could but I gotta leave you alone
(She said) I gotta leave you alone I-I-I-I
She said I know you bad, but I want you back
She said makes me so sad that I gotta leave you alone
(She said) I gotta leave you alone


I got my mind on my money
All I need’s a bad bitch
That I can run through the city spend this cash with
That I can run through this city spend this cash on
Wake up in the morning get my smash on
I want more much baby egg whites
Keep your stomach, inner thighs, and your legs right
While I’m out here focus getting this bread right
But if the head right, Jeezy there every night
Wake up in the morning and I'm still here
Wake up in the morning and I ain’t gone
All I ask, let me just do me
And maybe just me and you can get along
Had them other bitches mad when they seen us
Had to match our Rolex's baby team us
Yeah the earth is our turf we can share the world
Maybe even go half on a baby girl


She said you ain't no good but you feel so good
She said I would if I could but I gotta leave you alone
(She said) I gotta leave you alone I-I-I-I
She said I know you bad, but I want you back
She said makes me so sad that I gotta leave you alone
I gotta leave you alone


Let me be your mind reader, let me read your mind
And when I’m done with the front, hit it from behind
Love a loyalty never cross the line
Just hit a nigga up when I cross your mind
Show you how to get you on you won’t be watching mine
Put you up on G show you how to shine
And maybe we can kick it when I got the time
Be my backbone every nigga need a spine
Gotta know you ride with me if I’m right or wrong
Case I wake up in the morning and it’s all gone
Best believe I’ma get it right back
That’s the hustler in me I know you like that
You probably think I’m with a different broad every night
When I think about it shit man you’re probably right
The more I think about it shit you’re probably wrong
Cause what you didn’t think about is that I'm probably grown


She said you ain't no good but you feel so good
She said I would if I could but I gotta leave you alone
(She said) I gotta leave you alone I-I-I-I
She said I know you bad, but I want you back
She said makes me so sad that I gotta leave you alone
I gotta leave you alone


She said she wish she never met me
Cause she just can’t help but let me go ahead
And do whatever the hell I want
She said she hate how much she need me
Turn around, and say she don’t need me
Always talking about she gonna leave me
But she don’t
But maybe this time I’ll be different
Cause she shed so many tears
She’ll remind me all the dumb shit that I’ve done over the years
But she don’t be tripping in the moments I got her legs up by her ears
But as soon as we get done, I swear this is all I hear, yeah


She said you ain't no good but you feel so good
She said I would if I could but I gotta leave you alone
(She said) I gotta leave you alone I-I-I-I
She said I know you bad, but I want you back
She said makes me so sad that I gotta leave you alone
(She said) I gotta leave you alone
