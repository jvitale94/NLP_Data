

First I'm going to stack my flow 
Then I'm going to stack some more 
Close shop then I do my count 
Hide the rest of the yams at my auntie house 
Get fresh and jump in one of them cars 
Hit the club and get one of them broads 
It's a wrap we on the way to the house 
By 3:45 I'll be kicking her out

Patty cake patty cake microwave 
These suckas make a square, god damn I'm paid 
I'm so cool but I'm so hot and I'm so fly and you is so not 
Show me what your working with, just like that 
Turn around, bend over, bring it back 
Snowman and Mannie Fresh bring it back 
So Mannie Fresh and Snowman, it's a rap 

Wrap it up in the club, ya I'm so crazy 
These other rappers actors like Patrick Swayze 
I try to tell them but these niggas aint hear me 
Mossberg pump, i'm riding shotgun literally 
Live from the projects, you know what it is 
Hey Snowman can I get an adlib 
Get the club crunk, cant take that from me 
A drop ya, still got a lil jon money 

First I'm going to stack my flow 
Then I'm going to stack some more 
Close shop then I do my count 
Hide the rest of the yams at my auntie house 
Get fresh and jump in one of them cars 
Hit the club and get one of them broads 
It's a wrap on the way to the house 
By 3:45 I'll be kicking her out

I see you lookin, what you looking at 
Catch Snowman in the kitchen with his cooking ass
I'm so clean but I'm so grimey 
So dirty but yet I'm so shiney 
My nigga, Kiki B told me me finish my meal 
Def jam 7 figures we can finish the deal 
Some say I lucked up I call it perfect timing 
Nigga, I can't lose the whole city's behind me 

First I'm going to stack my flow 
Then I'm going to stack some more 
Close shop then I do my count 
Hide the rest of the yams at my auntie house 
Get fresh and jump in one of them cars 
Hit the club and get one of them broads 
It's a wrap on the way to the house 
By 3:45 I'll be kicking her out

I got million dollar dreams and federal nightmares 
We pop chris my niggas and still drink beer 
What did you expect man I came from nothing 
Real street niggas wouldnt change for nothing 
Got my nigga out the hood, it's such a wonderful feeling 
Three car garage with the twelve foot ceilings 
It ought to be a crime just to feel this good 
I swear it ought to be a crime just to be in this hood 

First I'm going to stack my flow 
Then I'm going to stack some more 
Close shop then I do my count 
Hide the rest of the yams at my auntie house 
Get fresh and jump in one of them cars 
Hit the club and get one of them broads 
It's a wrap on the way to the house 
My 345 I be king of the house
