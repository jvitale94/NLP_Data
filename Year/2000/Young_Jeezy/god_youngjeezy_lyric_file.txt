Young 5'8 tall like he 10 feet tall
Chopper make a nigga jump a 10 foot wall
Avian and gold bottles, this is hood royalty
No matter how broke, how rich
Nigga, never ever compromise your loyalty
Medusa head on my Versace robe
Standing on a pile of white bricks
Imagine crosses on the units
Stamps looking like a crucifix
Pure, like the blood of Virgin Mary
Turn water to some wine, nigga
Plug did a touchdown, met him at the Steak 'n Shake of Mt. Zion nigga

I'm a god in the hood, nigga 

Young 5'8 tall like he 10 feet tall
Chopper make a nigga jump a 10 foot wall
God shit, I'm on my Kanye
Bad bitch she my Kim K
Legend is that he made a million dollars
But the nigga really started with a four weight
Whom shall I fear, nigga
The plug say it's no limits
I sent the man right here, nigga
Snatch a partner out the state pen
Hallejulah, amen
Pull a little water from the sink
Hope it wash away the sin, nigga
The foe did a touchdown
Met him at the sand trails in West End, nigga

I'm a god in the hood, nigga 

Young 5'8 tall like he 10 feet tall
Chopper make a nigga jump a 10 foot wall
