Born september 28 my life far from great
No food on the table so we fought for steak
But im so close to jail feels lyke im so close to hell
Moms smokin rocks same shit im sellin
So who's wrong her or me
She addicted to tha high im addicted to tha cash
Almost put my hands on here when i caught her in my stash
How could i do like dat lord knows im wrong
Why would i do her like dat lord know she strong
I kno its been hard but we made it baby
10 years clean so she still my lady i must be dreamin


Dreamin' (always think about it) (i must be) (man i must be)
Dreamin' (always think about it) Dreamin' (ooooo rite)
Dreamin' (always think about it) (must be) man i must be
Dreamin' (always think about it) Dreamin' (oooo yea)


1 thing about it i got luv for you homie
2 things about it i take a slug for you homie
Look atchu now u's a buisness man
Im proud of u dawg handle ya buisness man
U like the brother i neva eva had
U try ya best n i still get mad
We risk's it all togetha been thru it all togetha
Caught cases n we still togetha
Headed OT i sleep while u driven
Me n my dawg ya we chippin on 5's
Rememba back when we shared our clothes
Look at us now we sell our shows i must be dreamin




I was young n dumb wit a pocket full of cash
Posted on the block wit a pocket full of glass
Full speed still runin from my pass
But its startin to catch up ya its gainin on my ass
Theres 2 types of niggas prediter n prey
Ima prediter i prey 3 times a day
Man u wants said one day u'll hav kids
N how u gonna explain all dat shit u did
Ima soul survivor we far from a crook
She always said i was a lot smarter then i looked
So i took my dreams n made it some thousands
Then i took my life n i made it a album i must be dreamin'
