Somebody call the weed man
I’m tryna get high


Woke up in the fits , damn sun in my face
Racks on my jeans, gun still on my waist
And I ain’t leaving shit in my cup, that’s such a waste
You know I’m sipping on that straight like that “oh, what a a taste!”
Tip the valet 100 dollars to stunt
Pulled up in that mean machine, leave it up front
This passed out thing beside me, I barely know her
But you can just imagine the shit I’m ’bout to show her
Snow way, them streets too cold
Expectations out of this world, I’m thinking solar
That’s why I do it for that Kalamazoo
And then NOLA, cause that’s what happens
When you learn to mix it with that soda


I need some weed now
Somebody call the weed man
I’m tryna get high


I wake up just to bake up, get my cake up and rise up
Motivating factors that I’m liver than most
I boast and bang, pour some pain in that thing
Put some purple rain on your brain, unravel the flame
Maintain my fame, get you new pictures
Just to put in your frame
We in the hood blowing kush with The Game
Foot in the cane, walking just like I’m an Indian chief
With no beef, real brief, with a wreath
You may think it’s a leaf!
With the residue stuck deep down in your teeth
When you smoking with the dogg, shit, you might not eat!
It’s ok, cause we lay, in the cut, on the hill, on the dip
With a fit on Crip, don’t trip


I need some weed now
Somebody call the weed man
I’m tryna get high


The coffee that I had, it was good to the last drop
But now I’m fresh out and you know it don’t… stop
So please man, somebody call the weed man
I’d call mine, but he’s been low on herb even
I’m fiending, daydreaming of the times when I had
Much mota, many different kinds in the bag
I fell hard for the funk, I can’t fake the love
I smoke dro, good Reggie, smoke shake to nugs
If it’s weed, then I’m with it
You got a paper? Then twist it? Got a bowl? Fill it?
Got a blunt?
Let me split it down the gut
But shit for what? Cause ain’t no green on the scene
Man, what the fuck?


I need some weed now
Somebody call the weed man
I’m tryna get high
