Yeah pull up with the semi
I'm the realest, I don't want shit nigga
Fuck you and your handout
I'd rather get it on my own
So If I ever lose it I know how to make them bands bounce back
I'm the realest, pull off in that Porsche, with no 
Strap all on my lap
If I get pulled over, my nigga take the case, he the realest
Damn that nigga need a house on the hills where I feel like that
She coming call me over to fuck
I fuck, I nut, I leave, she think



Rock so loud, I'm bout to go deaf
White and black store, bout to go rep
Its cold out here, I got 4 heats
Hog game here now got 4 seats
I'm in that double r with the AK
Straight  a nigga shit like Mayday
Pull up in the shit with  door
And you know I can't forget bout the meat floor
Steady fuck round me if you the police
Pink slips shawty baby no lease
I'm the type of nigga flip packs
Go count that paper like a therapy
You the type of nigga on some bullshit
Money always show, nigga 
You can ask the nigga from my whole block
Like the best 
You on your real nigga shit, pulling kick door
Every nigga know me, know I'm skit so
I'm the type of mothafucka wake up early in the morning
Cook a couple chickens up, no Crisco
Show em 4 or 5  like the backstreet niggas
4, 5 choppas on the backseat nigga
Nigga talking like they guess they athlete nigga
Fuck round  to try me nigga
