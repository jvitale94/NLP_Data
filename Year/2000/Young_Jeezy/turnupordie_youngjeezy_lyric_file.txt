Thirty minute conversation with my partner he in jail
He said "Young, don't you let these niggas trick you out your spot"
Homie on the inside nigga love you like you're Pac


Tell it fuck it I'm faded, 'bout to turn up I'm hot
All you hating ass niggas need to lay down and die
If a bitch text me now she might not get no reply
I'm too busy doing me I'm 'bout to turn up or die

Niggas turn up or die
Niggas turn up or die
Niggas flicking, niggas hating
Niggas turn up or die
Bitch turn up or die
Bitches turn up or die
Niggas hating, bitches flick
You gotta turn up or die


I'll see you back on the soul floor
Tell you niggas something that you didn't know
Grown ass man they on that little boy shit
Talk, talk, talking rack with no chest that's little boy shit
Can't pick your bitch self unless I put it down
When they was 24 a piece I serve the whole town
What the deal on streets want some new shit
Talking so hard this shit go where the news click
Told your own recession nigga I was playing to win
Pass these niggas 10 times they hit my rear view
I'm on this gangster Gibbs nigga I can hear you


Tell it fuck it I'm faded, 'bout to turn up I'm hot
All you hating ass niggas need to lay down and die
If a bitch text me now she might not get no reply
I'm too busy doing me I'm 'bout to turn up or die

Niggas turn up or die
Niggas turn up or die
Niggas flicking, niggas hating
Niggas turn up or die
Bitch turn up or die
Bitches turn up or die
Niggas hating, bitches flick
You gotta turn up or die


Ok I got an announcement
Niggas talking money ain't got an accountant
You can ball for the money yea I got 3
You niggas wanna play the game yea I got teeth
You can play with them other niggas homie not me
How dare you open up your mouth speaking on the cheat
Oh no Young is feeling like a spirit now
Guess it's time to play, shark in an aquarium
May you lil niggas talking on that lil shit
Pillar talking with them bitches ye that pillar shit
Ye you know I'm blowing killer, ye I'm killing shit
Streets say nigga get back on your dealership


Tell it fuck it I'm faded, 'bout to turn up I'm hot
All you hating ass niggas need to lay down and die
If a bitch text me now she might not get no reply
I'm too busy doing me I'm 'bout to turn up or die

Niggas turn up or die
Niggas turn up or die
Niggas flicking, niggas hating
Niggas turn up or die
Bitch turn up or die
Bitches turn up or die
Niggas hating, bitches flick
You gotta turn up or die
