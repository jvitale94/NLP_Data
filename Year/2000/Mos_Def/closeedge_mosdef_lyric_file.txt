Shine brighter than all o' them cats they got on glow
Lay in the cut like they not gonna know
'cause if I gotta make a move dawg they not gonna know
This door marked private this is not for sure
It's Mos Def what you call real for sure
Is they what you call gangsta, hell no
They get a little pinch and go snitch to the po'
They all talk fast and they all think slow
I'm Mos Definite, not think so
Flood your city with the black ink flow
And my crew ain't scared to let them things go
So, stop with the nonsense, like he conscious
I'm just awake dawg, I'm doin' great dawg
I don't play games so I don't player hate you all
Get it straight or get the fuck up out my face dawg
I'm like the second plane that made the towers face off
That shit that let you know it's really not a game dawg
Your grind and my grind ain't the same dawg
I'm the catalog, you the same song
So cool and ol' school like '84
The one your little mami windin' up on ways for
The name that real niggas got they hands raised for
Me and Mini got your block yellow taped off

Don't push me (get off)
'cause I'm close
To the streets, to the beach, the bitches, the niggas,
the women, the children, the workers,
the killers, the addicts, the dealers
the quiet, the livest, the realest
And that's close
Don't push me, 'cause I'm close
To the edge, back, middle and front
Strong back shit liftin' it up
From the big and the small
I'm like J. Brown gettin' Involved

But when I'm lettin' off a round don't get in the cross
Have your preacher man speakin' low gettin' his cross
Tell 'em wild cowboy not to get off they horse
Before they find out the town law's strictly enforced
It's a real bad way to get your name in the Source
Testin' the limits of a dangerous force
your ended up dumb famous and gone
Your people shoutin' out your name in they song
Pourin' liquor on the day you was born
Find paint to put your face on the wall
C'mon fall back, there's no need for all that
It's all good, we all here, goin' all out (all out)
All day, listen when this song say

Don't push me 'cause I'm close -
To the streets, to the beach, the bitches, the niggas,
The women, the children, the workers,
The killers, the addicts, the dealers
The quiet, the livest, the realest
- and that's close
Don't push me, cause I'm close
To the edge, back, middle, and front
Strong back shit liftin' it up
From the big and the small
I'm like J. Brown Gettin' Involved
Now get yours


Boom diggy bang-di-bang-di, boom bang diggy
