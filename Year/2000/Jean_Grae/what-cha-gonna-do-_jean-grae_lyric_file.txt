I got lost caught up and I'm back with the force
And our plan still in force see I better switch yours
Niggas lame like a door sample said Jean sample breath once
I can't front I need to get ahead
Not like hoes kneel to get ahead
I hop so deal till I break through for real
I'm punching your walls won't hold me your batches won't stop this rock
On its way to obnoxious, I need to prosper while I preach the gospel
It's a truth and in the booth I'm impossible
On the stage, on the page it's hussle
Dance to it, like it's foot loose white boy
Shake it with some crazy moves come on
I can't stand in your shoes
You ain't know, I plan other clues
Damage your crew, steady dismantling you
I can't handle this product of new being
And I'm smart enough to know the industry needs me off
Thrown alot shows hot niggas don't sleep
The postadress for toast without holding heat closely
Watch me run up in your potsie
You get gas like the nazis did
I catch flag like Roberto Duran drop in shit
I'm loose lip so I use it to abuse the music
Leave the track bruised up or the tracks used up
With the headphones slapped and the volume crunk
To a glass much better in a truck, oh bud
I'm closer this year New York shed a tear, give it up
What cha gonna do
When they try to take your shit from you

Been to pool went about to be a hot summer
And your wondering where Jean is coming from don't you
I propose we worry about where we gonna go
Turn your stereo up we're one step from spagettio pan shredded
But we're better though
Got alot of cheddar but now I gotta make the dough
Steady grind mind slipping into pity crime
Back me, I'm not in last I've been paying out your ass
Put your game face wrapped in a cask'
The same place that I'm rapping from
Will snatch your tongue and bite it off and snap your done
I like drastic moves, nigga run your shoes
What cha gonna do

If I told you in one breath
That my mission is to be the best
Would you mind your business and be impressed
Rush it off, dismiss now that's a test
Are you being fo' real Jean?
Ye the real dream is to field goal kick with the team, no less
And I'm not playing this just for kicks though
Slay this shit till I kick some lingo
I say so, but some days I fell off
From this day on I'ma state the cause
Never again play soft every rhyme is the play offs
Every time must be memory line sprayed off
You will remember me, I am a contender contrary to what you get generally
I'll take time let it sink in now
You gotta free your mind to the thinking part
You gotta get the signs I'm freaking off
So much shit that my voice start speaking off
Need this music as much as you
I'm a fan god damn it and I love it too, so
Wave your hands like the sandman's coming through
All cheers man we don't want the booze
In fact fuck that, get up and clap your paws together
Make noise like we wet up the floor, better
Wake up now like a spikey flit, good morning boy
I'm the type you leave with

What cha gonna do when the sky's start falling
I be out on the corner guess you all in
To the black caves and building smash pavement
And on look and gaze and amaze it's hypnotism
Just hitting the rhythm I fuck songs
All up in the bars like prisons are up yours
Like 7 and great God infinite new ways
Every minute to infiltrate strong on, eat your spinach
The confidence won't be diminished
Hold longer from start to finish now
You stop the inner child
You stop with an innocent smile
Pack your whips like splits listening for a while, c'mon

What cha gonna do
