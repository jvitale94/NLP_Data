$1
Not $2 tips at open bar
Keep it that way
There's nothing wrong with partying
Get the drinks going

Oh
Who's that?
Is that your girl? You with her
She look like everybody else in here

[Chorus:]
C'mon
They're not like me
(That's a shame)
Baby bet you know they're not like me
And everywhere you go it's not easy
Just to come across a girl like Jean
Oh no

C'mon it's not likely
And everywhere you go they're not like me (So what's up)
And baby bet you know it's not easy (Uh huh)
Just to come across a girl like Jean
oh no (Got a light y'all?)

Part of my composure
Saw ya
Had to approach ya, move closer
Confidence or the courtesy of the mimosas
Framed perfect
Like a picture with the sharpest image
From the lips of a cherub cherry red
Henny breast
Let me guess

Queens, is ya?
See Jean can read by the lean
And the tilt of the cap in your drink, I'll refill that
I need some good conversation, love
These hood rats be making up the game
Plus they ain't even fully developed
Insane

See if we could start a challenge
And balance most delicate matters
Involving plans
Including sitting in carriages
Wait
Too far
Maybe we could shoot a little hoop
Or just chill on my stoop
I don't like a lot of hoopla

Me and you sedude deuces and spike juices
and stove some backwards roll backwards
And keep it that good
So write your name
Oldschool
Pen on the back
Now what's a good time? Tomorrow?
I don't stall
Holla back

[Chorus:]

You see I walk up different on 'em
Talk slang often
Bought dinner on Dutch
While most women do the wallet clutch

Never ask the what question
Make jokes interestin'
Wear more clothes and let they eyes do the undressin'
A little sarcasm, bar savage, tar addict
Argue about reasonable doubt and Illmatic
Car traffic eyin'
We can walk in summer laughing
Cry when they giggle
Split sides and curse

The magic that's in between us boy
Jean a fiend for the love-feeling
We crush dream and after lush green
And a sun shinin' and enough beach for a lifetime
Or maybe that's just mine
Poppin in at hathaway
Wandering gay and rewind
Play a little chess strip
See but nothing
I read a lot
Beam you a little sixteen or something
I cook well
Sip on drinks and just chill
A malt liquor and MOP
Tell me what you feel

[Chorus:]

See we could be for life even
For nights freed and heavy and steaming
From polite greetin's to late at night face smashin
Taste passion and race plays baggage
My faith asking to place faith back in and maybe marriage
I hate slackers
Jean love to chill and lay out
Sometimes stay out
We'll find an open bar
I'm not impressed by payouts
So star, display out your cards
We can splay out on the top of cars
And pick the consolations
While playing the Best of the Bards y'all

Making me nod agreein
Patience is all I'm needing
Face it, I'm not your average girl
Or close to it even
Most original
Entranced by your physical plans
I've got a lot
But we could chill
It's all I ask
(it down)
