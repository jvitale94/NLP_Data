I should never started doing this song
On the first album. It's too much. It's much a...
Okay, let's take it back
Right where we left off
Two years ago on Attack I got to vent of course
Love Song, people said, "Jean, you wrote my life story."
It took a couple tries just to write this down homie
Anyhow
Let's go
Delve like a periscope
Four years in retrospect, take some time to recollect
I was livin' single now
Money in the bank account
Studio, loft bed
Truly mine, I paint it red
23, sellin' weed with Dutches taped on the cases
Hit up Envy every Wednesday at the club, I'm famous
For buyin' bottles at half price
Me and my girls act nice, relaxed life, dancin' with half pints
Kissed many a
Mister
Wasn't Mr. Right
That's okay, sister was lookin' for Mr. Tonight
And he'd called me up a couple times, we exchanged a couple lines
And I'd backtrack, repeat a couple times
When he hollered, hardly wasn't thinkin'
Except I'm lookin' fresh like every ex you dream of meetin'
On the humble, tumbled down a couple notches into swappin' spit
Gave myself and I knew that he was poppin' shit
Crumble into the advances
Mumblin', he's sorry dancin'
I couldn't stop the attraction, wasn't properly actin'
And so I got down and it wasn't nothin'
I kept on like my heart wasn't frontin' but I was hurtin' y'all
You can't believe that somebody that you love that much
Would ever bring they hands to you and properly touch
Face smack you, race back to when he kicked you in the back
Muscle relax and strugglin' to erase the facts
Only one I thought who really knew me
Threw me away truly
How cruelly can love treat you?
I learned a lot
Learned how to numb the pain
After the liquor I could split him up out of my brain
I continued on though
Dated a couple dudes
One was just lame, one broke my bathroom
But all in all it was an ill experience
I threw a couple parties, DJ I'm Serious
Cocaine, was curious
Was not for me though
Ended up smokin' more than I sold of the 'dro
I'm spendin' up all of the money I got in the bank
I'm thinkin' maybe I should probably slow down on the drinks
My intake is over levels of panicin', at three out of seven I've spent blackin' out
And no doubt
I don't know how to ration
Wakin' up and just feelin' smashed again but can't quit
It's still a love song
It's still a love song
Lord knows that I've waited so long
But all the love's wrong
Lord is my luck gone?
But just wait, the story goes on
The name Jason
I had replaced him
With the last verse's one
We were forsaken
But we're both so much alike, alcoholics
Tattoos
Except that he's brolic
So I called him
Up in my apartment
Watchin' cartoons
Drinkin' Old E and we're both stallin'
We need more drinks so we ventured out
To the club, liquored up, then we vent about
Why things never worked and then we started dancin'
He's aplogizin' and I'm entranced and then
For the next two weeks we were inseparable
Weed undetectable
Drinkin' til inept until
We would wile out
Both startin' fights
Every club, both carried a knife
Weapon lovers
We slept together
But check each other whenever it got too much
Bonnie & Clyde, rep whatever
He's my personal calendar
Appreciates the rhyme caliber
Feasts on diners every night after
Dancin'
Romancin' is never a problem
We got Envy's on Valentine's Day
It's a coffin
It's a wrap
Other niggas are dead
And then all of a sudden his voicemail's in my head
Just two weeks of this relationship
I should have known that this beauty would give way to some shit
I called him
From the studio
The way that he flip
And you'd think that he never just have lately kissed
He wanted space, started screamin' and I hazily grip
The phone, listen as he crazily tip the scales thrown
Off the hook man
Recorded +Love Venom+
For Mr. Len's album that night
Heart swellin'
I put his number in it
Fuck a love, I'm finished
Tuck in my feelings like a chain and fuck you niggas
It's still a love song
It's still a love song
Lord knows, I've waited for so long
But all the love's wrong
Lord has my luck gone?
Just wait, the story goes on
