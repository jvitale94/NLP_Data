(Verse)
Portrait priceless , splinter my agenda is cake
Ligoracce thoughts down town drape like the ice vendor
My performance is purple haze falling down the sky
Words of wool Draw Wilson captivate the consultance
Cash corporate the last sorceress
Blast the toaster and he splash all over the coaster
Trendy ass niggers kick ghost quick
Screw face haters, hate the way you nigga hussle
But it's in my culture
I work the muscles and the work room , rigorous weight lifting
But still I hold the bible in the court room trip
I hold the chips, blow zips crib sticky shit
Fix y'all niggers mouth damn y'all speak against
The laws of which you came from
Don't forget the name of brutalic rap niggers who brainstorm
Young to the AGE you might've seen me up in rascals
Up and 19 in that rice and gravy
Hold the bar two times the lady chemistry create a beat
My attribute, grand 5 o'clock ice plated ice to Asia
Nights of the Asia
Spanky white everything hopping off the beamer ,two seats

(Hook) x2
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, hold up
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, wait, nah
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, ok
Fuck you, fuck you, everybody

(Verse)
I got an all-star collection of ratchets
Multiple shells, multiple cells
To this bran out , plan out 21 cannons
My name ain't in the stanis but I'm a fiend in the hood
Say needs in the hood, with the wood to smoke
You laugh when you figure 'em out it's like Bagdad
And back to the bs but they still call me the X
3 X hood cook a cellar aye y'all
With the shell catches much more beat on the stretcher
The dark foam ,sunny skies turn gray
G only wanted it that way, ok
I'm the el capricorn what's fucking on that
Well all my dogs don't speak they all brrraat
Sun got smashed through the top of his hat
Layed out in the street with the spot where he sat
Always bragging about how he living fat
Now he's in he box look where a nigga at

(Hook) x2
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, hold up
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, wait, nah
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, ok
Fuck you, fuck you, everybody

(Verse)
Stupid I break your pectoral breast plate open
And leave your chest soaking in red
While I'm smoking 'em all burrow red
Thorough bread get up a gun, next I'll spit in your lung
Then mess along the jaw, your teeth and your tongue
I'm stuck to violent thoughts like the track to violent courts
We act all out of sort like a mac and a hand of the law
Handling all you with a tact that attack broad
You're like a gap stall package with wack product of law
I whore you , all you ,killer reanimate
Then slice you with a scythe through your psychical database
Until you glimmer our hope's gone,
I prolong your faith until your faith kicks in and kick your face in
Sir Lily queen and Jean and only 65 percent
Still murder 'cause I go further every time I vent
I love everybody, nope just kidding
I'm prone to having visions of slugging everybody
Pity God rap demi-God pocket of pennies
Lock it down like I'm Annie with a shot full of henny
You saying quack or rerap I keep it black like a jet of pan africans
With markers guard beat flying us back
The fist raise carve dissuade steps
Like a switchblade stuck in your side fucking you in it
Jean Grae bringing a new era, fuck the name
From now on refer to me only as Hera

(Hook) x2
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, hold up
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, wait, nah
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, ok
Fuck you, fuck you, everybody
