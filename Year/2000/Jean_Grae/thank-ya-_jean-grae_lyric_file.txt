Good evening Jean Grae, hello!

Y'all been wastin too much time
and done left the door open for me (really really, c'mon)
I mean sleepin, and fuckin up
well thank ya! Thank ya! (thank you, thanks a lot though)
Y'all been wastin too much time
and done left the door open for me
Y'all been sleepin, fuckin up, all around
Well thank ya!

I spit like the kids on the little bus - non-stop
Skill more disturbing than the thought of your ex
having sex with one of your parents (eww!)
All on top like the flip missionary mission
Beatch! I'm straight trippin like niggaz done killed my cousin
Been slept on, passed-over like in the Jewish tradition
Cast in cameos like I'm dressed in hand-me-downs
A step-sister, an afterthought, niggaz are shook, it's alright
Cause I +WILL+ smack you in the mouth, I'm Jean Grae
And it's an ill life, watchin these niggaz fall from ghetto grace
And I'm willin to fill in the blanks
Spillin slick like a drunken oil tanker
Killin off every rank in your squad (feelin me God?)
Vomitin constant drama 'til my larynx scarred (ow!)
No passin, it IS personal, fuck what you heard, it's been too long
I'm ready to go on, y'all still in dress rehearsal
Studyin lines with understudies and clique buddies
Y'all just bullshittin, practicin, and need to be quittin

* simultaneous
Time to build back the paper (time to do it)
Hurry up before we all go crazy (crazy, crazy, crazy)
* Been so long, so long, much too long
* Don't it make you kinda wonder, if you trust it (alright)
The biggest wheels in town are gettin busted (verse two)

Too, soon did you try and judge me, wait that's dumb conceited
Thinkin you even heard of the chick who's gonna kill you later
I'm kiddin; bitter cause I'm written off as some sex kitten
Freezy freaky bitches like in 80's mittens - it's so sad!
Hate an insane amount of dudes, underground to the death
I rep it, y'all been so supportive, don't download the record
Check me only in the "yes" box, never put "no" or "maybe"
My gimmick bend more lyrics, straight lyrics, no crazy
The jig is up for real; rap puppies jumpin up
and get a little treat for they deal
Shit all I need is a toke and a pack of stokes and then frequently I'll wait
And a mansion, weight and a shiny car, Jean Grae - superstar!
Really just look at what happens, cause cats is wiggin
"I know who should never hang out with Jerry's children!"
It's scarin, like women that ain't really women
Just dudes who tryin to holla at 'em
Fuck, that was confusing - just let the dude sing (alright)

* simultaneous
Time to build back the paper (it's time, it's time)
Hurry up before we all go crazy (crazy, crazy, crazy)
* Been so long, so long, much too long
* Don't it make you kinda wonder, if you trust it (f'real)
The biggest wheels in town are gettin busted (take it to the bridge!)
Too soon, we think, we know, too much, too soon we wanna play
While we let the best, of, the greatest, slip away (rewind!)

Y'all been wastin too much time
and done left the door open for me (thank you thank you)
I mean sleepin, and fuckin up
well thank ya! Thank ya! (thank you bitches!)
Y'all been wastin too much time (this is where it goes off-beat)
and done left the door open for me (still feel it though)
Y'all been sleepin, fuckin up, all around
Well thank ya! (good night!)
