Whisper:
(I cant be f**kin wit dem,

but they dont want to pay me.
They want to take my life,
I ask tha lord to save me.
Its super-serious now THAT YALL come its tha crazy lady.)

Normal voice: (Chorus)
I can't be f**kin wit dem,

They want to take my life,
I ask tha lord to save me,

I can't be f**kin wit dem,
