Now let me kick a little somethin' about this lady name Boo
Haven't you heard of the things that Miss Boo is capable to get
Get your mind twisted like some dreads on a Jamaican's heads
Vickie lingerie, countless lira petals on the bed

Blazing on some green, concentrating on what's next to next
Bet you by the dollar, make you holler, wait a minute
Come on out yo' pocket, don't be stoppin' what you havin', baby
How many busters get the chance of bein' a mental lady

Never, and I be goin' â€~cause my game is just too quick for [unverified]
Gangsta Boo be risin', all the Prophet Posse got my back
What you see in me, bust a boy is what I in to be
Sippin' on Henn' and grinnin' in your face tryin' to get your cheese

Why you be sayin' I'm dubbin' you out, but you're pagin' me
Never answer the phone â€~cause your name be on my caller ID
I guess you could say I'm kind of crazy in my own way
Forget bein' broke for days, lady gots to get paid

Where da dollas at, nigga, where da dollas at
Where da dollas at, nigga, where da dollas at, nigga
Where da dollas at, nigga, where da dollas at
Where da dollas at, nigga, where da dollas at, nigga

Where da dollas at, nigga, where da dollas at, nigga
Where da dollas at, nigga, where da dollas at, nigga

I be trippin' off you lemons in the club with no figures
With no car to drive in or no money to give up
I'm tryin' to see why you busters wanna play that way
You in a club, show me love, baby, do it that way

I'm not to be the lonely one lookin' sad and broke
No man to mob wit', no green to choke
Current times got me winin', conversation and kickin' it
Hook up with a little trick, now I'm back on my pimpin'

I'll teach an over-schemin' player how top take your man
But damn, I hope you understand money came with the scam
I be clubbin' Hennessey from New York to L.A.
It's all good, get my conflict on, smokin' on hay

You cheap ol' buggers gonna make me pull my thing for you, baby
I'll be out to get some dollars, I look out for this lady
You'll get twisted, mess with me on my wicked ambition
Like I told you once before I be the one that gets paid

Where da dollas at, nigga, where da dollas at

Where da dollas at, nigga, where da dollas at

I keep this thing in control, draped up with diamonds and gold
Players all up in my soul, I pause a [unverified] roll
Up in the VIPZ, these broads been waitin' to see me
I hope they tweek at my cheese, can't leave with less than a G

I'm scopin' out some more talent, need some new queens
For my palace [unverified], they hatin' on me like malice
Soon as I hot the front door, they scope the gold â€~round my collar
I'm here to come up on loot, I can't even spare a dollar

I got a Rolex around my wrist, trick
Can you freaks get some of this?
Some haters wanna take my place
Some rest and beg and ride in the click
I can't be stopped, the juice gon' shine

The truth be spoken in my rhyme
I'm livin' good and feelin' fine
I'm dazed on green, they're drinkin' wine
I just roll it up, I fold it up
The bottle's popped, pour it in my cup

The players who work from 9 to 5
Are only comin' to post it up
We still can ball, the juice appall
But this will make the shot we call
Entrepreneurs on worldwide tours
The only thing we savor is cheese and broads
