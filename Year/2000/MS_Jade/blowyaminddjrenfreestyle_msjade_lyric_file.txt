And Philly's number one DJ, DJ Ren
Uh, yeah


Yo yo, drop your glasses, shake ya asses
Philly's number one DJ Ren teachin' classes
Stop the dumbness, Ms. Jade run this
The gun in the clip, I'm making ya'll duck quick
Got different strategies, I play it from every angle
Philly chick, Slicker than Rick in his furry Kangol
From now on rap ain't rap without me
And y'all mad cuz Ren the best DJ
They gonna announce me, and ya'll gonna sleep
I'm gonna awake ya'll, and ya'll gon' peep
How a young broad from north Philly snuck up in the game
Why you tremblin', still sneakin' your cousin, shame
Substaintial amounts of money, I'm signin' my name
I'm workin' on the Caddy Pick-Up, ain't stuntin' the Range
Ya'll aint satisfied wit' jinglin' baby
Changed, the bold Ren, the best DJ in the damn game
Uh yeah, Ms. Jade, DJ Ren
Phillys number one DJ, 215, Beat Club, yea
