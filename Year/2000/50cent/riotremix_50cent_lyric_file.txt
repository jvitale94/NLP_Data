


I don't even know what to say
Ain't got to say much
You here my voice
You know it's 50


Damn right they got it, damn right they got it
Damn right they got it, damn right they got it
Damn right they got it, damn right they got it
Damn right they got it, damn right they got it

I say lame niggas be quiet, lame niggas be quiet
Lame niggas be quiet You in the presence of a real nigga
I say lame niggas be quiet, lame niggas be quiet,
Lame niggas be quiet
You in the real nigga's presence


I eat your girl up for breakfast, won't save you no extras
Say she fuck with me cause a real nigga's her preference
Drinking like I'm from Texas, and you know I stay flexin'
And if you don't know I go by Tity two necklace


Nigga that cocaine that I'm flipping
Wood-wood grain when I'm dipping
Codeine when I'm sippin'
Bitch, You fucking right I be trippin'
I put your bitch face in my lap
2-2-3s all in my strap
Count-count my paper
All of them stacks
Fuck something up and get it right back
Nigga try me


I'm a start a riot, I'm a start a riot
I'm a start a riot, I'm a start a riot
I'm a start a riot, I'm a start a riot
I'm a start a riot, I'm a start a riot


I ain't stunnin' these niggas
I ain't stunnin' these bitches
2 cigarrellas, look look like extensions (damn)
Yeah I'm from the south side, her mouth wide
My pack loud, My gat loud, I back out
And click clack pow pow
Court dates, still trial
My rep is a reptile
Now later, alligators
I step on a work like a step child (whoo)
Pimps up, hoes down
Make your girl pull her clothes down
Her hair down and I'm down
Her phone off so don't dial


That-that pyrex in my kitchen
Rich niggas still bitching
Them GDs and them vicelords
Or that gangsta shit I be kicking
Who Blood now? Who Cripping?
Who pussy? Tell me who snitching?
I got a firearm to fire on
For whoever done let that bitch in
These niggas don't live by the codes
Then cut in and fucked up the game
Throw your sets up if you don't give a fuck
It's 50 and 2 Chainz
Got the hood back poppin', I dance to this
I buy the whole bar, nigga you can drank to this
Get the bottles poppin'
While the hoes watchin'
And damn I love this gangsta shit


I'm a start a riot, I'm a start a riot (yeah)
I'm a start a riot, I'm a start a riot
I'm a start a riot, I'm a start a riot (that's what I'm talkin about)
I'm a start a riot, I'm a start a riot


We gone get back to the real shit,
Quit fucking around
