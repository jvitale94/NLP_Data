


Just one night, two night
It could be three of us
Yeh yeh yeh
Girl, we could get it ooon
Where ya’ girlfriend
Girl, we can have a ball
Bring ya’ girlfriend
Life’s too short to not fuck on the first date
No one knows if we’re promised tomorrow
But if we make love into the next day
We’ll have the rest of our time to celebrate


Four in the morning girl
Now I don’t wanna talk, we’ve been talkin for hours
Now you know I wanna’ fuck
Look I don’t understand what it
Is you don’t understand
My watch a hundred grand
My chain a hundred grand
Bitch, I’m a wanted man
I say I run New York
Cuz I do what the fuck I wanna do
They know wussup
They say my screws are lose
I say who cares, you know I’m rich
Look I don’t have time to blow wit’ a bitch shootin the shit
Now maybe you can loosen up and let me go to work
So I can whisper in your ear while pullin’ down your skirt
When I get the strokin’ girl you don’t know what to say
Quicky come quick, girl, I’m gone right away, yeh, you nasty, girl, you nasty
And I’m into that, so get at me!


I don’t want no good, good, good, good, girl
Me, I want a nasty girl
Come creep wit’ me
Be a freak for me
Life’s too short to not fuck on the first date
No one knows if we’re promised tomorrow
But if we make love into the next day
We’ll have the rest of our time to celebrate


I said beetch
I wanna fuck you in the worst way
Hell yeah, I wanna fuck you on the first date
If I don’t I say, fuck you on Thursday
Cuz then I won’t want you
Watch how fast I dump you
But right now I’m infatuated
You get to hang wit’ me
Girl, you graduated
I take you out for drinks and get you tipsy
Then I pull my dick out and I say kiss me
You’re ’bout to laugh ya little panties off
You only get one date
You better grab these balls
They wanna’ ride in fancy cars
That’s what bitches do
They like to rub it then suck it and lick it too
She’s a nasty little trap ho slut
But I like that shit, so let’s fuck
Beeeeitch


I don’t want no good, good, good, good, girl
Me, I want a nasty girl
Come creep wit’ me
Be a freak for me
Life’s too short to not fuck on the first date
No one knows if we’re promised tomorrow
But if we make love into the next day
We’ll have the rest of our time to celebrate




Ohhh, ehhhh
It sounds crazy
But tomorrow’s not promised
I mean, I mean I wanna’ do it today
I want it now
I don’t wanna’ wait
Wait for what?
My time’s runnin’ out
Your time’s runnin’ out
Come ‘er girl


Wanna’ fuck you beeeitch
I wanna fuck you beeitch
You only got
One date
Ain’t no tomorrows
