This is what it sounds like, when I'm breaking it down
Yeah I'm breaking it down
Man this is what it feels like, when I'm breaking it down
When you're breaking it down, keep breaking it down
It's not my fault c'mon, it's not my fault
I'm hot man! It's not my fault c'mon, it's not my fault

'Til the sun comes up, every night (c'mon)
We party and we party 'til daylight
We be getting it in, c'mon we're getting it in
A little Hennessy, a little juice and Gin
It's not a fantasy (nah) it's not pretend
We're gonna do it, we're gonna do it, we're gonna do it again
'Til the sun comes up, every night
We party and we party 'til daylight
I shouldn't have to tell you shorty you should know
I'm really really getting into your freak show
You give me a little baby then I want more
O.D.B. said it, "I like it raw!"
Exotic erotic we're moving on the floor
Enough to make a nigga lose control
I'm down to go wherever you wanna go
You got a man, I keep it on the low
I do my thing you know I miss my dough
I got a few stacks me and you could blow
We headed to the hotel after the show
I know how to romance you be my private dancer


On your mark, get set girl now here we go
Racing off to see your peep show
It turn me on to see you on the floor
When you're breaking it down, keep breaking it down
Ready or not shorty now here I come
Shake that thing girl now back it up
Work it, work it girl you turn me on
When you're breaking it down, keep breaking it down


They say I'm not the same it's 'cause I'm filthy mayne
I'm off the chain, I don't play no games
I'm hustling hard homie I do my thing
You fuck with the paper then watch the hammer go bang
Now shorty I like the way she move them hips
I'm trying to get her in my bedroom and shit
We could take a long time or get it done quick
We can camcord this shit make a boom-boom flick
It's oh so many places that we can go
I really want you shorty, shorty now you should know
Girl your body's calling me, hear you loud and clear
We ain't got to leave now we can do it right here




The way you move (the way you move)
You make me lose (you make me lose)
All control (all control)
I know you know (I know you know)
You're so seductive you make me wanna touch it
I ain't got to tell you, you know I wanna fuck you
I'm feeling your style, you better watch me now
My tongue'll be in your mouth, my hands'll be in your blouse
When you get me aroused you put a spell on me
Man if I can't have you I'ma go crazy
I want you bad now and if you want me
Girl killing me now, or succumb to me now


Come to me now, you don't come to now
Apple in your mouth, tackled on the couch
Shackled in the house, I'll be back in about
20 minutes or less, with my Hannibal mask
So when you wiggle around and giggle in that cage
I knew I couldn't wait to get you off that stage
From the moment I met you had to let you know
I just wanted to get you through my bedroom door
You making me feel like I'm in middle school still
You squeal like a little girl, you're pitiful, chill
We're gonna fuck, I just popped this little blue pill
You can leave but wait, I gotta shit on you still (phbbt)
I shouldn't have to say it shorty you should know
I hope you really gettin into my creep show
Let me shit on your chest and if some pee comes out
Just guzzle it down, just guzzle it down




It's not my fault c'mon, it's not my fault
I could break it down, it's not my fault c'mon, it's not my fault
Can you break it down? It's not my fault c'mon, it's not my fault
I can break it down, it's not my fault c'mon, it's not my fault
Can you break it down? It's not my fault c'mon
