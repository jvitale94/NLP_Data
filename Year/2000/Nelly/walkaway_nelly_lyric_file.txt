Switchin up your hair, got your "freak 'em" dress on
Photo shoot fresh like you about to perform
And I'm a fuckin mess, I had you on my arm
Woke up you was gone, I can't even blame ya
Now you in the arms of a stranger
And now I'm all alone with this anger
You used to feel safe, now I'm danger
'til when you had to leave, without a warnin
Such a whirlwind, I want my girlfriend
Got me on ten, I can't even pretend
You used to love me, but now you want him


And I hope you're happy
Hope you got what you wanted
And since I'm no longer wanted
I guess, I'll walk, away (guess I got to walk away, yeah)
I really hope he makes you happy
I hope he gives you everything that you wanted (all the things that you wanted)
By your presence I'm holdin
I guess, I'll walk, away (guess I got to walk away, yeah)


Girl you got me out here stressin, I'm on some manic depressant
I'm switchin up how I'm feelin, I'm listenin to suggestions
And your expression is mute
But your nose all up in the air, how cute
And I could write a book on how to
ruin a good thing, livin without you
Thought I'll pay for my wrongs, guess I ain't have enough
Told me "Nigga I'm leavin," I had to call your bluff
Now I'm callin your phone, but you ain't pickin up
I should've gave you love, I should've gave you trust
And now you moved on, and you forgettin us
I'm singin this sad song, but you don't give a fuck


And I hope you're happy
Hope you got what you wanted
And since I'm no longer wanted
I guess, I'll walk, away (guess I got to walk away, yeah)
I really hope he makes you happy
I hope he gives you everything that you wanted (all the things that you wanted)
By your presence I'm holdin
I guess, I'll walk, away (guess I got to walk away, yeah)

There's nothin that hurts more than heartbreak
No one wants to take that fall
You're thinkin about her all day
Nothin else matters at all
And the only thing worse than her leavin
Is knowin it's your fault
And now I'm goin through withdrawals


I hope you're happy (I hope you're happy)
Hope you got what you wanted (all the things that you wanted)
And since I'm no longer wanted
I guess, I'll walk, away (guess I got to walk away, yeah)
I really hope he makes you happy
I hope he gives you everything that you wanted (all the things that you wanted)
By your presence I'm holdin
I guess, I'll walk, away (guess I got to walk away, yeah)
