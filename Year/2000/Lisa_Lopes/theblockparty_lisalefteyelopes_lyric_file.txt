Uh, uh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah one time
Two times, shake it down now

Remember way back in the day (hey hey)
When the kids from around the way
Used to come out and play
And the double dutch bus
Had you bumpin' on down the street
Tryin' to move your feet
While you shake your little booty
To the groove of the beat (uh)
To the beat
To the beat (beat)
You hit the corner and you stopped
Hey y'all there's a party on the other block
We hit the jackpot
Jackpot (what what)
And it's only 12 o'clock
And the sun is hot
Free soda pop
We about to rock rock rock rock...

Music pumping and we're jumping
And they played our favorite songs

We were dancing all night long

I'm a big city girl
From all over the world
And I do what I wanna do

Then you take it on down
Then you shake it around
Bring it up
Clap your hands
Then you turn it all around

Remember when we did the wop (pop pop)
And you used to make that head bop (bop)
Like it would never stop (stop)
And them other grown folks
Gettin' busy with the gigolo
Drinkin' Michelob
It was 6am before they hit the road (uh)

Them fat gold chains and high top banks (hey)

About to hit the spot
