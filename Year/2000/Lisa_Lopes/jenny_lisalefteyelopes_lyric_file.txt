What what what, man turn that down...
Gimme five more minutes
Five more minutes...

What times is it? I'm tired man
11:59 already

Wake up in the morning one thing on my mind
Cheerios with vanilla on my milk
It's all mine, I devour, take a shower
Grab the papers and sack
See ya'll later I'm packed
Smoked up till I get cataract
Laid in the Cadillac
Switch lanes out of the driveway
Like I was on the highway (yeah)
I ride a big boy
Y'all ride a similac and oh my Cadillac
Has 50's in the back
Playin' Rick James and Tina, so relaxing
Passed on by the neighbor Red Lane
They called him insane
Here's Mr. Chang limps with a cane
Had a crush on Ms. Payne
Blessed and he's strange
Now he can't walk the same
Innocent three-legged rover
Kinda says four-leafed clover
His owner smooth Jason
Yeah Jane like Playstation
Had the girl's hearts racin'
Like you're nervous and pacin'
Well I swerved the curb
Corner action like verb
Cops throwin' the bird you heard
I'm on I-20 wit' 20's (unh-huh)
And beats I got plenty can't wait to see Jenny

I been all around the world, met a lot of girls
Jenny, yeah that's my dog
I been so many places, seen so many faces
Still ain't none like my dog
I been around the world and back again
Ain't nobody like her yet
Don't forget your homies, can't forget my homies

Well, as sun starts to dim and I'm under the speed limit
And there's hectic traffic too, got off at exit 22
Stopped at Lorraine's she's datin' Mr. Kane
And she's just as deranged and insane in the brain
Man she blew up his Range, shouted things so profane
Unh-huh (sounds like Left Eye)
So we go to Pit's Lane, way over by the main
To get the rest of our girls
With them ghetto ass names
Toleda, Bonnie, Quesha
With them hairdo's
Look like they went through a seizure
You know, went to the movies
And you can't see the feature (ha ha)
And Jenny's father's a preacher
And see her unleashed around daddy so sweet
Without daddy she a freak (she a ho!)
Ain't never seen her with the same nigga for weeks
Naahh wait a minute (yeah)
I seen her three times with Saadiq

I been all around the world, met a lot of girls
Jenny, yeah that's my dog
I been so many places, seen so many faces
Still ain't none like my dog
I been around the world and back again
Ain't nobody like her yet
Don't forget your homies, can't forget my homies

Pull up to Jenny's and she's waitin' outside
My hair ain't done get your ass in the ride
It's Friday night, me I'm high and tight
Jenny sippin' on the Henny, I'm drivin' tonight
My exhaust is about to ignite, we turn on Morland Ave.
And then I see these blue lights (blue lights make me nervous)
I feel fright Jenny yells I ain't goin' to jail tonight girl
So anyway I'm drivin' slow, then enormously fast
Then Jenny dumps her shit and I slammed on the gas
She says I'm fucked up (ha!)
Not to mention all the weed in the ride
And the way we drive and are stupid to ride
I bust a right on Memorial Drive (go left left)
She threw out the Henn and I threw out the stash
And we was goin' so fuckin' and oh so fast
And we stopped, the cops had caught us at last
Knew I forgot somethin' I might have needed some gas
So the cop walked up knocked on the window
I dropped, I ain't drunk, I forgot Jenny's uncle's a cop
Yo relax it's me man, you just forgot your keys
Your keys? Dumbass nigga
I can't believe I threw out my stash
I shoulda whooped your ass
I know I have some crazy Friday nights
But somethin' about Jenny makes it alright

I been all around the world, met a lot of girls
Jenny, yeah that's my dog
I been so many places, seen so many faces
Still ain't none like my dog
I been around the world and back again
Ain't nobody like her yet
Don't forget your homies, can't forget my homies
