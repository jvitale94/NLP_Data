

Untouchable, look at how you found me
I'm lookin' around sayin' these are my friends
It's a strange world my enemies are my friends
More of the same street, same world, same problems
Is this indifferent?
Same drama, same karma, same mama
Is it different?
The only difference is me
I see inside the truth
Feel bad you don't know the day gon' come
When God has taken you
I see the invisible spirits, walkin' along the physical mind
Of a crazy individual
Where demons still find it livable
I need a hug to hold my soul inside my body
I got the secret here
Yeah, I should have told somebody
'Cause ever since I've been sayin' things I never meant
It's like I was speakin' in tongues, the black breath in my lungs
I won't allow it
Where the cowards live under the dirt in the flowers
Ready to come up in the darkest hour
It ain't the courage of my persona
You wanna admire it's the faith
'Cause with the faith I can walk through the fire
(Now feel me)

I know you feel me it's the untouchable
Make yourself presentable
I'm listenin' to mysteries of the untold (uh-oh)
Echoin' inside my soul
I know you feel me it's the untouchable
Make yourself presentable
I'm listenin' to mysteries of the untold (uh-oh)
Echoin' inside my soul

Sometimes I'm feelin' like I'm sinkin'
Thinkin' what it's like from on the other side
When I look at myself it's like my love had died
People thinkin' of gettin' richer
I'm usin' the blood of the loves that I lost recently
To paint a perfect picture
Can you see the future, future endeavors
That'll make us better
Usin' the light from my wings to make us fly together
Guide my people to a place like what you imagined
My duty now is to God
There's no more beauty pageants we gettin' the chance to thank Him
Me and you finally for what they made
Is it a game that they still playin'
Look at us now we're rid of grief
Payin' society's debt but life we still obeyin'
Until then I'll follow the path
Where will it lead?
Much in between ashes and dust
We must believe trickin' thee ain't trickin' me
I got tricks up my sleeve
They tryin' to market I'm tryin' to make my mark before I leave

I know you feel me it's the untouchable
Make yourself presentable
I'm listenin' to mysteries of the untold (uh-oh)
Echoin' inside my soul
I know you feel me it's the untouchable
Make yourself presentable
I'm listenin' to mysteries of the untold (uh-oh)
Echoin' inside my soul

I know you feel me it's the untouchable
Make yourself presentable, make yourself presentable
I will ride untouchable
After the fire comes the rain
After the pleasure there's pain
Even though we broke for the moment
We ball in the game
Time to make y'all my military
Be prepared for the busters
I'mma let ya bitches that's scary
Get to hear me no questions
Visions of overpacked prisons
Flingin's and niggas thug livin', precious
Three strikes, I hope they don't test us
And pull a heater ammunition is great
Move without a sound
And we slide down pistols in place
I'm sensin' niggas just defenses
From hittin' bitches to gettin' those
Who can prevent the shootin' senses
At these niggas throats only wish to breed
I explode into a million seeds y'all remember me
Legendary live eternally then bury me in pieces
'Cause they fear reincarnation, niggas screamin' peace
'Cause they fear
We must wanna face 'em, take 'em to places
Fake their fates then erase 'em, and break 'em
Murder my niggas I'm tired of waitin'
Now quicken the pace
Blast me but never ask me to live a lie
Am I wrong 'cause I wanna get it on til' I die?
Now worldwide
Niggas got the black girls, they hide
No offense to Nas
But this whole fuckin' world is mine
Even if you blind
You can still see my prophecy
My destiny to overthrow
Those on top of me fiendin' for currency
The money be callin'
Can you feel me dreamin'?
Seein' scenes of me ballin'?
Niggas that made niggas and that bitch
What you goin' through
Outlaws bustin' while we rush it
Untouchable
Niggas that play fucked up now what you goin' through
We outlaws rushin' 'em bustin'
We untouchable, untouchable, untouchable (uh-oh)

Echoin' inside my soul, untouchable (uh-oh)
Echoin' inside my soul, untouchable (uh-oh)
Echoin' inside my soul, untouchable (uh-oh)
Echoin' inside my soul, untouchable (uh-oh)

Echoin' inside my soul
Ya'll niggas never stop, you never drop, you never let me fall
Me 2 Pacalypse
All I know how to do is ball, ball, ball
My true fuckin' niggas survived reincarnation
After I'm dead they'll rock and roll
And bring the funk to the whole nation
And you know these fuckin' niggas
Have a gun with my name on it, untouchable
I spit the game so clear it's playin' on it
When I'm dead
My niggas will ride for me
Untouchable (untouchable)
Untouchable (untouchable)
Untouchable (untouchable)
Expect me like you expect Jesus to come back
Expect me nigga, I'm comin'
