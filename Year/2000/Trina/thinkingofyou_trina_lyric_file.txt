I'm thinking of you
All I can do, is just think about you
Thinking of you, I'm thinking of you
All I can do, is just think about you
Thinking of you

I'm visualizing, me and you on an island
Black sand, holding hands, and covered in diamonds
Look up in the sky it's an unicorn
And I can't get enough of how you do me boy
I see me ripping off your clothes, kissing on your chest
I'm down to your stomach so you know what's coming next
My fantasy, a trip, I'm thinking bout the hot spot
Late night, skype conversations from the laptop
Got your t shirt on, your cologne on it
Make me feel like you still right at home in it
Check your phone come help me take off this negligee
And he reply with an lol smiley face

Thinking of you, I'm thinking of you
I'm thinking of you
All I can do, is just think about you
Thinking of you, I'm thinking of you
All I can do, is just think about you

And I'm legs back, arms back
Squeezing on your thighs,
Make that ass feel the fire
I'm just visualizing it, you telling me where's that
I'm a put my mouth on it, whatever to get it wet
Cause I just wanna see you smile when it's over with
Lay in bed and talk about how we grow and shit
First kiss upon your neck then go to your hip
Dynamite dick, how you think napoleon hit bomb
Bomb, you be looking bomb
Dressed good, smell good, that should be a crime
Even on skype I'm checking you from behind
And you can have the world
As long as I know you're mine
Girl I'm thinking of you

Thinking of you, I'm thinking of you
I'm thinking of you
All I can do, is just think about you
Thinking of you, I'm thinking of you
All I can do, is just think about you
Thinking of you.
