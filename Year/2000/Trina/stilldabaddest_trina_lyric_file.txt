I say da bitch is back
Yeah da bitch is back (I got da keys I'm fen to drive come on let's ride)

Back seat Phantom
Dark tents rolled down
Didn't want to see her look at me now

Say she couldn't rap but I'm still here standing
The baddest bitch is what the fuck they yelling

She's not real
That one's fack
I step in da booth kill a track one take
Trina one break I'm so heavy weight
Look at the map, I'm from the gun shake state

Don't ne bitch want it
Bitch tighten up
Only bitch with a deal
Slip n slide what
Swam across the Atlantic, back stroked back
Just mark my words I'm a take that back

Gon burn des charts
Stack every lock
Gon grace every cover
Dis bitch here hot
To give you all a lesson
Let me put it on the dresser
Where I put my damn shoes I will not lose

Ya'll gon learn to respect the queen yesterday it was all a dream 
I'm still da baddest bitch ah 
Ain't another, I'm the baddest bitch
Damn right I'm the baddest bitch

It was all a dream
Think it should be gone like that
Wake up this ain't a dream
Your worse nightmare'z back
B-A-D. bitch bad to the bone
Home wrecker number 1
And queen of ring tones

Now observe the persona
Fuck your feedback
I'm equivalent to none
You cuts lab rats
Experimenting MySpace
Fishing for a hit
Ma picture price gone double when they drop this shit
Sky box panel break through all doors
I'm hurricane Katrina when it rains it pours
Takin no pity trampedin ova bitches
Niggas can get it too
I ain't no where near through
Hood that's how you want
Good cuz imma get it
Since I heard a motherfucka say the sky is the limit
Yea I know you want
Yea cuz imma give it
Since I heard a mother fucka say the sky is the limit
I'm out

Yaw gon learn to respect the queen yesterday it was all a dream 
I'm still da baddest bitch ah 
Ain't another, I'm the baddest bitch
Damn right I'm the baddest bitch

YUP! (yup)

Yaw gon learn to respect da queen
Yesterday it wuz all a dream 
I'm still da baddest bitch ah
