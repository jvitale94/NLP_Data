Moe miney meenie inny 

I got a bottle, I got a cup
I got ice, so what's up
Walk in the club when suicide close
Feelin like money cause I collect dough
Moe miney meenie inny
Wheres that patrone and hinney
I been sippin on cabonney that shits so strong
Like paris hilton, gotta carry me home
So full, so far gone
Forgot where I parked, n lost my iPhone
Still lookin good and pretty bad bitch in every city
Rocks, diamonds, I got plenty
Ice for the cup, now pour the hinney
Escorted in the club, I brought the whole team
Ain't no guest, buts it's a rockstar theme
Everybody lookin of course it's the queen
They admirin the crown, and the 10 carat ring
I'm known for pimpin these rappers
Exspecially to get a nice walk on my actin
When they actually think that I'm feelin em
That's wen I take they money, then I'm killin em

I got a bottle, I got a cup
I got ice, so what's up
Walk in the club when suicide close
Feelin like money cause I collect dough
Moe miney meenie inny
Wheres that patrone and hinney

Watch me get ghost in the phantom
Somethin like a pimp like david banner

Tied up blue diamond shoes

Stuntin on you, like boo who you
