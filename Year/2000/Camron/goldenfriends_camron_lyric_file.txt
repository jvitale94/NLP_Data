


Thank you for being a friend
Travelled down the road and back again
Your heart is true, you're a pal and confident


Killa season has returned ya'll
Wanna wanna, wanna say thank you
To that cocaina
That coke I got off the boat
That I made float then copped that Beamer
Over her I clock the Nina
No denyin, no swerve the time and yea I love er
Got my mother out the gutter, word to mammy
Mammy, where your real friends at?
Poverty put a end to that
You ain't got it, they don't come around
Only come around for your income tax but
Shout your homeboy or your homegirl
They know you're game
They let you hold they car
Playin kids, put yo phone in they name
True, they along for the ride with ya
Even when you're dead wrong
Right by your side with ya
In the club bump, ya'll go for the right pictures
Somebody act, they down to fight with ya
I held his kicks, he let me hug his chicks
Oh pardon me, oh I'm just talkin bout huddy 6
So if you with yo girlfriend, wink of your eye
And if you with your homeboy, put a drink in the sky


High fall, high fall
High fall, high fall
High fall, high fall
Now tell them niggas




Thanks to british, he's some other guy, word
We make mothers cry
I had to sing their son a lullaby, woa
Alibies, alibies, we kept more than one
Wet T-shirt, no water gun
He a business man, now all are young
Grandma raised me, Manic South took it over though
Thanks to Ziki, he kept my pockets on overflow
Gave me my first deal, bands gave me my first wheel
But thanks to Hector Garcia Sr. â€“ gave me my first meal (gracias papi)
Wanna thank God, my Lord the savior lookin over me
Thanks to Tania, for years I tore up her ovaries (wuddup girl?)
Thanks east, west, north, south, overseas, Peru
No thanks to these racks that think you on G's
But you with your girlfriend, start swingin yo hair
If you were the real friend put a ring in the air


High fall, high fall
High fall, high fall
High fall, high fall
Now tell them niggas
