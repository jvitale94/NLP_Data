These niggas got no morals, values, or principles
Listen you, what you saying I can't listen to
Stop it, my bank better off robbing municipal
Its difficult to break bread when there's too many birds
I couldn't hear what you said, you used too many words
Four lift, three quarter that did too many 
Me in Timbs, the BM's, we hustled on the curbs
Yall diligent with the Dillinger
Done with the D, I'm Mr. C like the finisher
Get rid of ya, send ya home like you a visitor
Fall back Ma if I ain't feelin ya, I ain't feelin ya
Only the feds the kid fear
Find me in multiples of niggas with dreads and big beards
Rip, tear, just hit me up when you get near
5 for 22 I'm like WOOO, Ric Flair


Yo, lets get clear, white airs, slick gears
My fingers right in a bitch ear
Damn, buried him, I get the fifth tear
Musical chairs, yall can't sit here
But besides that, yall dudes should lie back
Ain't nothing funny, so dead all the wise tracks
When you get hit with a pipe back, fight back, I like that
Put you next door to Mike Jack
Roomate: Redfox, I'm from Lenox
My Jamaicans, rudeboys, Lennox
We bumpin in, (where?) the Comfort Inn
100 thousand in the duffle, dump it in
Not double dutch, the weed jumping in
Fair one, come on yall acting dumb again
And in the trap hood, yall better act good
Well treat you like leaves and roll your ass in the Backwoods


Get it clear, if you want it we get it in
Need more then six pairs I'm like WOOO, Ric Flair
Listen here, no longer we pitching hairs
The wrong application you better get a different career
Get it clear, if you want it we get it in
Need more then six pairs I'm like WOOO, Ric Flair
Listen here, no longer we pitching hairs
The wrong application you better get a different career
