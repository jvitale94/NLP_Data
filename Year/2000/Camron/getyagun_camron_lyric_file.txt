

And now a word from out local sponsor


Gun possession is a hazardous war affecting children in their homes and schools
Eight children a day die from a gunshot wound in the U.S.
A million violent gun crimes are committed by 18 to 20 year olds
with homicide being the leading cause of death
How is it possible that 200 million guns
are owned in the U.S. with only 80 million legal owners?
Until we do something, guns will continue to flood the streets
along with the consequences

DipSet, Please

The restrictions are endless
