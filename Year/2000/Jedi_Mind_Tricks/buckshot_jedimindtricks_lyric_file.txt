Look into the eyes..."
  

My style orbits
Around nine planets of forces
Ominous metaphorics in vision of double corpses
Lying order, mad scientist slash doctor
Present the type of horror that boils your holy water
Get warped with the knowledge that folds the holy father
Hard boys become toys inside the real saga
So why bother
My whole flaw lines is harder
So bring the drama
We all know the signs is smarter
I set off crowds, style wild like a circus
I seek through souls when I walk past churches
Allah praise you, stay true to a devine purpose
Seeking out the wise wherever the dark searches
Flows that I embark and leave your squadron shadow dodging
Lyrics are softened like slugs that fill harkness
No option, narrow odds
Fucking with god is straight gambling with your tarot cards
  

  

Open the gates of Midian
For the fangs like the flesh
Three cyborgs who Bang like Ladesh
We hang the best
Spit venom until your face burn
Yet the critics are parasitic like a tape worm
The hate burn, scathe the urn of a Buddhist
Snake turn and fake yearns to kiss 'em cutest
We take lives with knives steady abusing ya
With the vicious intentions of denting your uvula
Bruising ya with text of a Harvard class
Ikon will smash into shards of glass
To reform into a whirlwind of sand
Then reborn into the word Hologram
A solid man with plans to intwine matter
Mind splatter from the grind of my divine hammer
