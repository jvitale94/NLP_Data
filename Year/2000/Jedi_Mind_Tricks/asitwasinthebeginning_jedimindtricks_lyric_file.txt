Relic illadelphia, right words of power
Him who was holy, who holds the key
That opens, no one can sit it
Sick ven-a-nicious, sound of seven trumpets
Those synagogues of Satan
Will fall down at my feet, knowing I've awakened;
I'm comin' soon for them, Elohim's New Jerusalem
Puttin', millennium, quintisential christians
Two, shall be revealed, by the seven cathedral seal
As above soap elope a whole David Shill
Eli, Eli, lama sabbachthani
Those who defame me, shall keep open my wounds
No liars, allowed in the school of Mogoon


Seven plagues of the seven angels
Seven emcee's get strangled by the seven holiest triangles
Eye of magnum, plexy glass beams that see through
Sons of Evil, like Ronnie Knievel
I believe you, of the lamb, prepare for the verbal slaughter
Save your breath, like you was under water
I am torture, like the fear of internationalism
Nazi eugenics and economic rationalism
I am the ming, born on to the swords
And I am the bing, bringin' holy wars
Orators from the womb of Ilyuwn
Glory be to, the, sustain a El Kaloom
Gabriel fell from the steps of the heavens
Extraditing evil, knew the angels in the seventh


As it was in the beginning
So shall it shall be in the end


Black Tibetan Aby-Abyssinians
That begins the extortiation of the fullations
Battle through the tombs of the Shangri-La
Illadelphia Shambhalla, enter the paradictum
Of Rasululah, Assyrian celestial Hebrews
Pellets, of the historians, hieroglyphic
And I am, the silhouttes, a risky end inventor
The I'll czar shine of two one five
Beyold sons of limitless light, porder rights
That's reveal, from the seventh heavenly hill
The book of El's angel, the apocalyptic tabernacle sacred
Sephirotic prophetical chapels
The synagogues of El Kaloom, the ghost fills the monastery
Sanctuary cathedral, from the kingdom of Melchezidek
We the mystic regime of the Annunaki Elohim
We were originated, from land, the blackness
Of light was formulated, from our sylapsis
If you get, tarnished in all phrases, and salutation
To the mercifullness, glory of the Sunz of Mansion




Sink like the Titan', into the cold
Dark waters of the ocean, my thought modes
Different land and center motion
Elevated to rise, beyond the shores, revelators
For episodes to the future, energy seekin'
Intruder, infiltrate the periemeter
Lock your MIA, initiation chamber
Move to the guard snakes, not a stranger
With four large spiritual anger
