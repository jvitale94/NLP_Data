 For sendin' my little cousin into the damn war
 What the fuck we on sombody else's land for?
 Murder innocent people for Uncle Sam's law
 Everybody know it's all over oil
 It's all for the greed and the money that ain't for you
 it's off with the head of *blanked out* that ain't loyal
 Off with the head of a snake, he ain't for you
  givin' dollars to the Taliban
 And young Americans dead before they had a fam
 Look, I don't got a beef with the war
 I got a beef with a war mistreatin' the poor
 I got beef with everything that he do
 I got beef with the lies misleading the youth
 And I'm about to take the law in my own hands
 And I'm about to  a grown man
  we should run up at night
 Black masks, black tape, black 
 Should we terrorize the city like the summer of Sam?
 Or should we bang this  without a plan?



 We 
 And I'm about to run up in this motherfucker and blast
 First things first, cousin, how we get in?
 We could take the janitor for all they gear and they timbs
 e could tell them that we tryin' to raise money for aids
 And we could start the onslaught for all they criminal ways
 Now that we in here, where the fuckin ?
 Where my four pound?
 Where my fuckin knife at? My fault, it's right here with the spiked bat
 We dettin' them raw, nobody can fight back
 Probably in the bedroom scared to death
 Gunshots, wait till you see whats next
 Des, kick in the door! if the  make a move 
 Nigga it's movin, the  took a piss on the floor
  ain't gettin' nothing else except a kick in the jaw
 Tell  we need more money for poor folks
 And to respect others like the book that Allah wrote
 Nah, nigga, I ain't with that deal
 Oh  how it feel?
