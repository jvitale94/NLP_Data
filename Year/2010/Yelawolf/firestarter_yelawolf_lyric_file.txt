That's why everywhere that I go they try to put me out
Bitch, I'm a firestarter, hot damn!
But this fire's out of control and bitch you can't put me out


Uh, uh, uh, uh I'm a firestarter,
Uh, uh, uh, uh yeah, I'm a problem!
Uh, uh, uh, uh I'm a firestarter,
Uh, uh, uh, uh yeah, I'm a problem!


Sticks and stones and bricks and bones
Lift to me dome, get all of my calls
Spitting my wishes, push on me cold
But the coke and the pigment take me Rose!
Reaching my own shit, ready to hang me down
You're an original, you know when you're standing out
You just staying around, ready for God 'cause like a wiz they panning out
Pulling your panties up, oh!
Ride no more, and I don't end up like a duck for the season hear me outs
Move when they fare me out
Yea, you was hoping to fare me out
But the harder the pain, the bigger my fame gets
Call me a motherfucker speaking my language
Chain this, bang this, I'm a bang on your head
Til you fall like a steep, and it easy get painless
While I stand over your monument like a crane lift
30 thousand galons on the palet to paint with
But even though I give you many colors to paint with
You would pick up the machine with my fucking painting
So go ahead and make your changes
I'll be back in the booth with a fucking flame lit!
I'm a firestarter, but you don't find water
You don't know me son, like I don't know my father

You just gotta relax, homie, yeah!
Breathe in, breathe out (and breathe)
'Cause this fire in me
Breathe in, breathe out
It ain't going out
Breathe in, breathe out
I was born to be this shit
Breathe in, breathe out
Just gotta realize

Cause all my life I've been a firestarter
I don't know what it is about my soul that's got me hot and bothered
Somebody find me water, somebody find me water
Cause I'm hotter than a preacher's daughter,
Hotter than dry leaves in August
Yeah, I'm a firestarter!


Uh, uh, uh, uh I'm a firestarter,
Uh, uh, uh, uh yeah, I'm a problem!
Uh, uh, uh, uh I'm a firestarter,
Uh, uh, uh, uh yeah, I'm a problem!


And I'm dialing
Better pick the telephone, me calling
Cat fish, really got the drill up on calling
Act to the wall and run for the office
In the back window steel, where the ball get?
AK clappin, no nigga pow that
Choppers always, coppers all get
Young, we barely to live in the morning
Death to my haters, say bitch to your coffin
Death to them coffin, ten toes down motherfucker I'm owling
Ya'll play too much, get to pause it
Remind yourself that the Wolf is a auction
Going once, going twice, 25-35-50-50-55, balling!
Better take it in mind partner
Trunk music is a piece of gold
Uh, yeay! Take you to the truck and throw it in the day
What you got here? Now better give Denzel the white boy's redneck
With all due respect
So run it back til you go this leg
See? Long wings like dead
See city girls, bathroom nightmare
Seats back in the line
You already know who make these!

I'm a firestarter, sweet dream, sweet dreams
Bitch, I'm a firestarter, sweet dream, sweet dreams


Uh, uh, uh, uh I'm a firestarter,
Uh, uh, uh, uh yeah, I'm a problem!
Uh, uh, uh, uh I'm a firestarter,

But this fire's out of control and bitch you can't put me out
