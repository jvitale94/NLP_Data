So wrong for me?
And everything I’m holding close, is so far away from me
They don’t want me to lie, but they don’t wanna hear the truth
It never made sense to me
Why everything I love the most is so wrong for me


Problematic, I’m so problematic that I’m probably a problem addict
Poppin’ aspirin cause my head is hurting
Hotel bedroom missing curtains
Sheets everywhere like a storm has passed
In fact it looks like I got into a wrestling match
Empty bottle of Jack, I can tell I did that
I can smell it in fact, it’s like death and ass
Think for a minute, then roll over and look
To my left, is an open book, the Bible
To my right is a guilty conscious her name is Brook, my rival
At least I think her name is Brook?
She’s asleep and I’m givin’ her the lamest look
Move her hair back so I can see her face
Cause it was dark when I met her at the game
It took about five minutes to get her inside the whip
Another five minutes to get up inside the lips
Never tried, really man I really tried to slip out
But it was just thighs and hips
Okay, I was high and shit
On alcohol and a Yelawolf ego-trip
Leave her lying in bed, cause I don’t need no kiss
And it’s the walk of shame again


Why is everything I love the most
So wrong for me?
And everything I’m holding close, is so far away from me
They don’t want me to lie, but they don’t wanna hear the truth
It never made sense to me
Why everything I love the most is so wrong for me


Smokin’ out, throwin’ up
Keep a fifth off in my cup
Trying not to be a simp
But every time I take a sip
I think I’m gonna fall in lust
I’m back and forth like I’m packing a truck
In a house that never runs out of boxes
Knowing that if I put on my tennis shoes
And a fresh fit, I’ll end up sockless
By the end of the night, flip flopping
I’ll B-Boy if you let me Hip Hop in
Alligator skin cowgirl boots only means let’s get it crockin’
That mini skirt makes any man a flirt
Manicures animal furs and a purse
What could a little bit a smoke and Henny hurt?
You make any jerk make a penny work
Sinister with sin in her
She can leave a devil sitting in the church
On another level not in the earth
Jessica Alba had twins at birth
Trippin’ sure, piles of E, ménage-a-trois, piles of three
Waking up again not proud of me
Yeah, I’m a lousy fiend


Why is everything I love the most
So wrong for me?
And everything I’m holding close, is so far away from me
They don’t want me to lie, but they don’t wanna hear the truth
It never made sense to me
Why everything I love the most is so wrong for me
