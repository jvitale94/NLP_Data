Is that really what you want?
'Cause I got what you want in my pocket.
Hand me the keys I'll hand you the sun.
Is that really what you need?
'Cause I got what you need in my rocket.

(5) Babies in lines to pick from.
(4) Yeap, and I'm wondering, which one,
(3) number moves best to the kick drum.
(2) Kick me to the moon it's this one (1)


One, two, three, feet and rising
There were five I wanted to plug one.
Hey the day in L.A.'s got so what's night in Alabama do you want some son?
So, what's a 20 minute flight pulling your boots like Napoleon Dynamite.
We worked up but we worked biting appetite
Looking at Earth from my personal satellite.
Got it right, they got left. Going up, take a breath.
It's a giant leap for all mankind
But for us it's just a simple step, baby step.

People in cars go vroom.
Speeding to the dope go wroom wroom.
Let's go half on a tank
If you got some fuel then I got that boom (boom)
Crank my truck I'm still a country boy PBR's in a cup
You wanna see inside the Astronaut farmer
5 4 3 2 1... buckle up.

Damn, she's got the ground control.
I'm looking at the sky where should we go to.
Na-na-na-Night
Lights in the club don't shine like that tha-tha- that's gotta be your back
You almost gave me a heart attack.
You must to put somethin in my Cognac
I'm kind a like an Alabama headache at.
Myspace game will now be maxed
And if you wanna know where I'll be at.
The ships are fat with...
