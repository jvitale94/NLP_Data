And we go to the bar about a quarter til 2 and it was awe awe-awe-awe-awe on

Ha-hah
No, not you my lady, I’m illegally parked I know
Pardon my French and my Mercedes
But I have no excuse for this flea market shirt I’m wearing
My Motley Crue is beastly and we enjoy the staring
I’m unemployed and daring
How dare I be so cool when it's
So hot in Alabama, sometimes we get snow too
And I’m as rare as a white Christmas in Miami, really
The temperatures droppin’ don’t stop, bitch, the oceans getting’ chilly
But I’m drivin’ (I’m drivin’, I’m drivin’)
My people (My people)
To party (To party)
Party (Yeah)
Cus I’m drinkin’ (Cus I’m drinkin’)
Get rowdy (Get rowdy)
P-P-P-P-P- Party

Yes I jumped off the boat
And I’m sinkin’ in my chair cause my beer bottle does not float
Help me now (Now)
Please enjoy the show, I done come up so fast that I’m afraid of heights, I gotta go
Help me down
Or I’ll just learn to balance
Somewhere between commercial dreams and music that is valid (Yeah)
My babies need to eat so I create a simple sound
The Fiasco threw me for a Lup-é, I dumbed it down, Slick
Rick E. Bobby, I’m drivin’ (I’m drivin’)
My people (My people)
To party (To party)
Party (Yeah)
Cus I’m drinkin’ (Cus I’m drinkin’)

Yeah, my people are ridin’, in trucks and wheels oversized
In such a world I reside, and you’ll let one go if your pride
And enough to give you a bottle, been throwin’ troubles around
I got them car keys in hand, I know what the fucks goin’ down
Some of these people come sick, so pop their trunk for a gaze
They wanna do bodily harm, they wanna live for the day
We just came to get stupid, so gimmie that bottle of Crown
I take my girl to my Caprice and get the fuck outta town
C’mon girl, and I’m drivin’ (I’m drivin’)
My people (My people)
To party (To party)
Party (Yeah)
Cus I’m drinkin’ (Cus I’m drinkin’)
