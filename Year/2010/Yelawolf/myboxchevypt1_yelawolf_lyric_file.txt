Chevy, I love you baby. Let's ride around today. How do you feel?
I feel good too. Let's ride around and see if we can't pick up...you know...Catfish.


Look I don't really know, how you feel about steppin' in to my car to roll.
How do you feel about lettin' me drop this money roll on ya?
But I don't do that dough, maybe meet me halfway baby if you're really (gonna) cut, (gonna) what (gonna) take me down the road, experience something new that I've never seen before.
Give me a song to sing to. You could be the one to hold my secrets. Girl my lips are closed (I need it)
You (peep it) I (believe it) cars (clean) and so (come see this) 
 

My wheels are super clean, paint job it glitters and gleams,
and I wanna see the back of your jeans in the seats (MY BOX CHEVY)
This whip is built for Queens and you wanna be seen witta King,
well I wanna see the back of your jeans in seats (MY BOX CHEVY)
Tilted off Jim Bean, sittin low to the side I lean,
and I wanna see the back of your jeans in the seats (MY BOX CHEVY)
My wheels are super clean, paint job it glitters and gleams
well I wanna see the back of your jeans in seats (MY BOX CHEVY)
 

You know I like the way you look when you get a wax down.
You sparkle in the street like, when we pass by rollin' around town.
Your spokes are beautiful too, how many of those do you got on you?
Original hubcaps shine naturally got swagger.
And true, you used to be in the junkyard, sittin' by your lonesome till I got up in you once and changed you up now everybody hollerin' "I want some!"
But I ain't one to share, I don't mind if you crowd around and stare.
Custom will get you cut from the women that's on the prowl for a car that's rare.

So you had a good day, huh? I know, I know. Me too.
We really did our thing. We really did our thing tonight, Chevy.
That's right. You love me? Shit, I love you too, chill out.
I might have to put you in park. You buggin'.
You wanna go back out? Yo man, my lil' buddy. My lil' Chevy!

Off the top. Love your car...love my car. Yep, yep...my Box Chevy...You got anything you wanna say Chevy?
