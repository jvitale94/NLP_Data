


I left my family at home
To go and sing my song
I know the music pays the bills y’all
But I still feel wrong


Baby I’m doing the best that I can yes I am
And I catch myself running everytime
Really only fall behind 
That’s why I gotta just rewind


Take it easy
There’s no need to speed
Slow it down
Take it easy


Baby what’s wrong
Are you alright?
I’m only here for a few days
Lets make it a good night


Baby you’re doing the best that you can yes ma’m
If you catch yourself running sometimes
Take a breath and recline that he loves you
Just rewind


Take it easy
There’s no need to speed
Slow it down
Take it easy


I’ve been around
I’ve had my back to the wall
But it’s a humble inexperience
To find that I haven’t been through nothing at all


Cuz even when you doing the best that you can you can die
If it don’t matter leave it behind leave your family your time and your love
And just rewind


Take it easy
There’s no need to speed
Slow it down
And take it easy


There’s no need to rush, slow it down , take it easy 
There’s no need to speed, no need to rush, hurry up, slow it down
