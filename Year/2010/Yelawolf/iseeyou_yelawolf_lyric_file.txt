My grandmother told me one day I’d change
I felt like she was coming down on me
So I told her no, I’d be the same
Not knowing she was only trying to help
Motivate me to excel and climb
I was thinking she was the one trapped
While I was stuck in the cage of my mind
Man if I would’ve known what I know now
I would have brought my head down out of that cloud
Told her thank you and that I loved her
But I was too cool and too damn proud
What a fool I was in fact
I’ve changed so much, now looking back
I wish somebody I thought was cool
Was cool as she was when she told me that


I see you, the real you
Trying to cover up what’s inside of you
But everything you do, is make believe
Yeah you’re hot, but you’re too cool
I see you!
I see you!
I see you!


Baby girl don’t know much about
What it would take to become a star
Hollywood is so far fetched
Too long of a drive in an old car
Work every day but you barely eat
Going over lines from a script you read
Your boyfriend said it’s a silly dream
But how can you dream when you never sleep
You’re looking in the mirror and you’re picturing a light show
A glimpse in the lens of a camera
Behind the scenes of life as a tightrope
Yea you walk a thin line
But a thin line is all you need
A thin line in an Indy movie
Just a break for somebody to see the
Talent inside, the ballad of a diary you write
The by and by is just another day for a normal girl
But for you it’s another day that you tried
Aside from the fact that you ride in the back of a bus
Sometimes cause your car won’t work
Well maybe you should take that bus to L.A.
And put your dreams first because…


I see you, the real you
Trying to cover up what’s inside of you
But everything you do, is make believe
Yeah you’re hot, but you’re too cool
I see you!
I see you!
I see you!


Black and white, everything is black and white
Broke down, simple and plain
Most of us lost with a curious brain
Curiosity is looked at as strange
Stuck in a lane, but you can’t complain
While you look at another passing train
Wondering how, where’s it going?
Wishing you were inside, packed and rolling
To another place, but your time is chosen
To live low key, ‘cause your dream is stolen
They don’t understand, they believe in loathing
Lounging, loafing, waiting, hoping
Homie if the grass is greener
Look, the gate is open
You’re waiting for God to release the ocean
Sitting on the beach two feet from floating
But I see you..


I see you, the real you
Trying to cover up what’s inside of you
But everything you do, is make believe
Yeah you’re hot, but you’re too cool
I see you!
I see you!
I see you!
