And take away the stars cause you light up the night
Feel as high as the moon when you’re here with me
That’s why I’m gonna write your name for the world to see


Another old man on the porch with a bottle
Wind blows and the old rocking chair wobbles
He’s just a waving, everybody’s welcomed
All he can say about the youth is Lord help ‘em
Gotta couple grandbabies but they never call though
Let him in the South and they moved to Chicago
Wife’s in Heaven and he says ever since
Vietnam life’s been hard as a veteran
Simple life just a 6-pack, ice cold
Crossed the Georgia line for a ticket for the Lotto
Probably never see his name in the headlines
But if I had a plane I’d put it in the sky
Alabama!


I’ll write your name across the sky
And take away the stars cause you light up the night
Feel as high as the moon when you’re here with me
That’s why I’m gonna write your name for the world to see


She’s in love yeah, friends call her crazy
Met him at a party they started dating
Daddy’s little angel, mama’s little lady
Only sixteen now Brenda’s got a baby
She can’t afford to, drop out of high school
Jimmy’s not a man and he can’t provide you
He doesn’t want to, but you kept it anyhow
Nine months down the road, whatcha gonna do now?
Go to the food stamp office and apply
If you find a job it’ll help you get by
And you made it when you didn’t know how
Now that’s a real star, put her name in clouds
Alabama!


I’ll write your name across the sky
And take away the stars cause you light up the night
Feel as high as the moon when you’re here with me
That’s why I’m gonna write your name for the world to see


You may never be on television
Or be the one your boss at work loves
Giving you employee of the month
You may never be the first string on a champion team
You may be the star the world just hasn’t seen
But that don’t make you any less of a star to God
Being rich is only realizing it’s all a facade
You’re richer than you think in that old small town
Cause people like you make the world go ‘round
Alabama!


I’ll write your name across the sky
And take away the stars cause you light up the night
Feel as high as the moon when you’re here with me
That’s why I’m gonna write your name for the world to see
