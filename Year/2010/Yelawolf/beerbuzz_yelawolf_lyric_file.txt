I need y'all to drop me some of that country-ass shit.
I need somethin' that'll make Sheryl Crow go,
"goddamn, that shit's raw right there."
 

I like a good beer buzz, early in the mornin'.
And Billy likes to peel the labels off his bottles of Bud. 
 

You know the sun shines real early in the mornin' time through the window of my trailer in the pines.
I need a little somethin' to shade that light, a beer buzz starts my day off right.
Granny's in the kitchen, cookin' and singin'.
Zoup get me up, look at what he brings in.
Hey, ain't that a 12 pack, buddy? "Yessir, you know I ride dirty."
I ain't even got a shower yet, but I devour a 12oz. in 3 seconds.
And its a alchy's weddin', I married the Bud and know I'm in Heaven.
Sheryl Crow is the queen, I really I wish I had her here to drink with me.
But for now, it's just me and Dixie.
I'm one down, Transent hit me.

Well, the roosters crowin'. My boxers saggin' and my ass is showin'.
Walkin' through the yard to get my mail.
I'm feelin' good if I say so myself.
Wave to the neighbor, sittin' on his porch.
He hates my guts, yeah of course.
His daughter hangs out with us on the weekends.
But I throw the peace sign, cheers my friend.
I ain't got no problems here. I drink beer, my head is clear.
My eyes are foggy, I don't feel groggy.
Will I drink more by 12? Prob'ly.
But now I'm chilled out though, tuesday mornin' nowhere to go.
Fire up the grill and call some bros, we four-wheel drivin' off the road, like that.

Chillin' on a monday, drinkin' my brew day.
For another beer I'll gladly pay you on tuesday.
Come on lets ride around, get high ride around.
Six pack, twelve pack, we can all drink 'em down.
Drink 'em down, drink 'em down, drink 'em down, drink 'em down.
Six pack, twelve pack, we can all drink 'em down.


I like a good beer buzz, early in the mornin'...from his bottles of Bud, don't you?
That's right, early in the mornin'.
Catfish Billy...from his bottles of Bud.
Hey, you know this is the kinda jam you can just drink to.
But then again, you can drink to all my shit.
Billy likes to peel the labels from his bottles of Bud.
Yo, early in the mornin'...yeah.
Dixie Mafia, Supahot Beats...from his bottles of Bud.
