See I was born to rock and roll
My momma kept me close to home
While my daddy was a rolling stone
So I rock (so I rock) and I roll (and I roll)
And I rock (and I rock) and I roll-oh-oh-oh-oh
So I rock (so I rock) and I roll (and I roll)
And I rock (and I rock) and I roll-oh-oh-oh-oh


Who remembers trying to make a dollar out of 15 cents
Who remembers sneaking into liquor stores tryna get bent
Who remembers stealing every album out of pops old car?
And listening to those growning up tryna be a rock star
Back in the days b-back in the days backpack full of Andres
That's three stacks and the chronic no weight
More like three dollars and a 2pac safe
Principal calling my dad, Colson isn't showin up to class
Colson got into a fight your son isn't gonna pass
Well your damn right my books were in the trash
I was at Sharks playing guitar with the band, jam
Pretend like we were playing for some fans
Go to chance like we were paying for some bands, ran
Security caught us we got banned now dad's at home
Drunk waiting with heavy hands bam
So I ran away with whatever CD it was that I was gonna play
Music always had my back when its just me in the dark
Fell asleep on the slide in the park wake up


Let me tell you how the story goes
See I was born to rock and roll
My momma kept me close to home
While my daddy was a rolling stone
So I rock (so I rock) and I roll (and I roll)
And I rock (and I rock) and I roll-oh-oh-oh-oh
So I rock (so I rock) and I roll (and I roll)
And I rock (and I rock) and I roll-oh-oh-oh-oh


Today I took four shots
Leaned out my window and pissed on four cops
Noise complaints everyday knock knock
But I'm busy with four porn stars on my cock
Busy damagin hotels and gift shops
Quick to shoplift take a wrist watch
Put me on a stage at a show and I mosh
I done shaved so much blow that I rock
 seem like every morning my lawyer is on the phone
Talkin bout another fight or another case from another night
Where the dude backstage at a place upstate but I'm done with it
My life have fun with it call my little brother up tell him get the drums hittin'
Tell the rest of the band to plug up and yell to the rest of these bands to shut up
Mic check 1, 2 if you don't like me than check your IQ
Cause I ain't dumb my mind is just numb from all the substance inside that I've done
I had to try some meanwhile I'm young though in the strip club with all of my ones
But you don't want to live my life I'm just telling you about the highlights, Kells


Let me tell you how the story goes
See I was born to rock and roll
My momma kept me close to home
While my daddy was a rolling stone
So I rock (so I rock) and I roll (and I roll)
And I rock (and I rock) and I roll-oh-oh-oh-oh
So I rock (so I rock) and I roll (and I roll)
And I rock (and I rock) and I roll-oh-oh-oh-oh

Hold on let me catch my breath
Ok over here to the left
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (I like this)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (right side what's up?)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (woooooo yeah)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (y'all ready)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (come on)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (yeah, louda, yeah)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (yeahhhhhhh)

Okay
Everyday, Mary Jane
everyday, every night
if I said it then I meant it
shit I'm on this every night
