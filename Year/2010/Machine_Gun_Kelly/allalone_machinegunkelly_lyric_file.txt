

I'm all alone
In the unknown
So on my own
Someone help me in my escape
I'm all alone (uh)

What I'm gon' do now?
I'm going through withdrawls
from this lonliness
I'm captain of my ship
without a crew now
Sinkin in the deep end
I ain't even in the pool
broke the mirror cuz I'm sick
of knowing all I got is you now
My knuckles bleeding
My back is against the wall
screaming at my shadows
they ain't saying nothing at all
I'm going crazy
conversation when nobody talks
So tell me how my ears are ringing
when ain't nobody's called
huh? yeah
But in this life of mine
Friends are expendable
living in a life of crime
Every morning pillows soaking
from the nights of crying
Knowing the choice is either jail or dying
but here we go

here we go 
down this lonely road
Searching further
for something more
In this dark world
I'm so alone
Can someone rescue me from my own
I'm all alone
In the unknown
So on my own
Someone help me light the way
I'm all alone
In the unknown
So on my own
Someone help me in my escape
I'm all alone

yeah, in a position I wasnt ready to take
pushin the countless decisions
I wasnt ready to make
but I do it
refuse it, I cant
its stupid as fate
this is the life I chose 
and I dont have room for mistakes
but everyday I wanna give up
stomach hurtin like I did a sit up
anxiety tightens my throat like a hiccup
Thinking about the things in my past
I cant get rid of
every single thing I eat I gotta spit up
and every time I get up
my world is spinning
so where am I facing
cant stop thinking
my mind is racing
somebody come get me outta here
cuz now my only hopes of escaping
is the sound of a (bang) 
please save me

here we go 
down this lonely road
Searching further
for something more
In this dark world
I'm so alone
Can someone rescue me from my own
I'm all alone
In the unknown
So on my own
Someone help me light the way
I'm all alone
In the unknown
So on my own
Someone help me in my escape
I'm all alone
Where do I start?
to begin
when I thought I couldn't win
I gave back in
to my self
I cant wish it away
maybe another day
I'll wish this away
I'm all alone
In the unknown
So on my own
Someone help me light the way
I'm all alone
In the unknown
So on my own
Someone help me in my escape
I'm all alone
