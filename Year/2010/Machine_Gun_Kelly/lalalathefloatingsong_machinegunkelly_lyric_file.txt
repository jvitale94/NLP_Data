Can the drummer get some huh??
Indeed,
Phat tracks,
Good weed,
Anthrax,
U know we Loud,
Baby the bands back
Smokin hash now my hashtag's pass dat,
And i never need cashback,
My green is on the credit of the fact that im the muthafuckin man jack,
Coming straight out of the land where them Cavs at,
Good stock of tree take me I get higher then the Nasdaq,
Burn somethin,
Me and my friends fried,
Spicy chicken sand- which, some burgers, and french fries,
And my Cherry slushie,
That's red as my friends eyes,
So god damn high i Fell asleep in my friends ride, shit,
I'm fucked up,
But these the days I live fo,
For every J I smoke I fuck a bitch I'm a nympho,
I wouldn't trade this for a million bucks,
My best friends, my blunts, and my chucks, wassup,


La la la,
Look at the clock like,
La la la,
It don't stop huh?
La la la,
Stay up all night,
La la la,
We just watch uh,
La la la,
Bumping that new shit,
La la la,
This my jam,
So roll it up and let's float again,


I wake up to no rules, no bed,
We crashin on the couch,
Leftover food,
No bread, I guess we eatin out,
A couple hoops, fuck yeah, you know we ballin out,
And after that? smoke sesh, we never on a droubt,
We got them swishers, king size zig zags and all utensils,
OG kush big bags, edibles in the kitchen,
Plus the air match the smoke around my tattoo'd initials,
So fire up the muthafuckin bong like its a missile,
Where the bitches? somebody call the cell,
Tell em bring the liquor some mixers and high heels,
I'm half naked and all these ladies is as well
And you would be if u burn like we burnin I'm hot as hell
Shell's stuffed with the finest product these dealers sell,
I swear we done ran thru more papers this summer then the mail,
Fuck it, two tears in a bucket, let's get by,
Live for the moment let's get high,
And we floatin like


La la la,
Look at the clock like,
La la la,
It don't stop huh?
La la la,
Stay up all night,
La la la,
We just watch uh,
La la la,
Bumping that new shit,
La la la,
This my jam,
So roll it up and let's float again,
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
