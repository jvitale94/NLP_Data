

It was all a dream motherfucker, 17 motherfucker
Trying to ball like I’m playing on a team motherfucker
Like Kareem motherfucker, what it seems motherfuckerer
Me, I’m out here winning, Charlie Sheen motherfucker
On any given Sunday, Willie Bean motherfucker
In the hood like Radio Raheem motherfucker
Blowing good but this ain’t no porch scene motherfucker
This that smoke until your numb morphine motherfucker
Because the life is a fucking war scene motherfucker
So much grimy shit, I’mma need quarantine motherfucker
Aye and then maybe I can ride clean motherfucker
Hit the ghetto in a black limousine motherfucker
And how dare you ever judge me motherfucker?
Paid my daughter’s college fund with 16’s motherfucker
Baby mamas out here trying to Billie Jean a motherfucker
But I’m on my trill shit, bring a Bun B for the rocker, nah I mean motherfucker?
