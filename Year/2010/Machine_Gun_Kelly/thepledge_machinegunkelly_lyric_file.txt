


It’s just uhh, trials and tribulations
This world is fuckin’ crazy
When I’m screamin’, “free my man”, the crowd’s screaming "congratulations"
Cuz we came from couches, two family houses, to corporations
And I know these streets are a dead end, but these streets embraced me
People I fuck with call me “Kellz”, that’s what the streets named me
Fuck where you think I’m from or how I live, the streets raised me
& fuck the world for hittin’ my girl with that stray, and let the tears run down my face onto a casket after wakenin’
I’m thankful for livin’ this long, cuz a lot of us don’t make it
RIP to homie Rock who got shot right after graduation
& JoJo was an animal, I guess that’s why they caged him
Caught in a vicious cycle of life as a young teenager
My history class is bullshit, they feed us false information
Fuck the founding fathers, millions died over Benjamin Franklin
My brother fought in Iraq, but it might as well been prison
Cuz he’s home but his sanity didn’t come wit him
Fuck the world screamin’..


I pledge allegiance, to the streets. Hold it down, keep it G
I gave the Lord, my soul to keep. That’s why I’m still standin, in my Chuck T’s
In my chuck T’s. In my chuck t’s. I’m still strong, in my chuck T’s
I pledge allegiance, to the fans, to be the realest motherfucker that I can
That I can, that I can. Remain the realest motherfucker that I can
So when they lay me down to sleep, the last of a dying breed.. RIP


Jesus died for me, government lied to me
These people say they loyal, I just hope they ride for me
& if I die before I wake, then cry for me
& keep my motherfuckin’ name alive for me
Now, I done seen some things that I would never tell my daughter
& did some shit that I’m ashamed of, forget of what I gotta
I know the Devil’s hot, but I got something hotter
& my boys ain’t from Jamaica, but they some fuckin’ Shottas
We never start no fights, but we’ll go to war
EST tatted on us, that’s something will die for
These faggots had shit handed to em, but we earned it
Roll a J, yell out my window, Lace the Fuck Up then I burn it
Turned into the opposite of what they thought I would, skippin’ classes
Voice of a revolution of troubled youth, kiss our asses
& if government conspiracies are lies, then why the dollar got the all seeing eye?
