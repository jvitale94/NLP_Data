Got a tattoo across my chest

I got a box of the swisher sweets
I get a box every single week
My eyes so low, I ride solo
I tell ‘er ho come blow with the chief
I got a blunt bitch runnin’ by me
If my pack here talk and say come and try me
No stress between fine G’s
As long they stay the fuck away from my tree
Yea, EST my team
We go Wu Tang on that crim
Girl head full of oil she
Cuz I have her hair by the zip of my jeans
I’m fly, take a look at my wings
Realize I’m in need of supervising
Nigga no strap but the gun go bang
So do my pack yea lick the chain
I insist we talk about train man, a chick recognize my game
She do some shit that I can’t explain
It’s like an angel within’ her brain
She sucks (she sucks) She sucks (she sucks)
Like a dirt ball go for show
I let her break down all of my tree
And she go for the head, might put that on

No seed inside my sack
Better don’t be OG my pack
I got this AC in my cup
When I’m with Chuck we be sippin’ that yuck
We be sippin’ that yuck, gonna throw that back
Take 2 puffs, let ‘er stroke my shaft
Slim so slow but I never roll
I cut like the mold of the stove
I got them shook like a bottle of Rose
E and my team, we pop and go
Your girl wanna kiss my tat
Fuckin’ stay, let ‘er suck my swag
And I came inside her life
And introduces that girl that bag
That pad, that paddy up turn it down, loud is loud
Them people lookin’ around, uh that’s smellin’ like a pound
But there ain’t no shame in my game
My kush got a crazy name
I like that mouth that trampoline
I’m so high, I be rockin’ in 10 uh
