Or do I gotta scream like I did every day when I was a troubled teen, huh?
Do you want to know my past and see every single scar and know what they mean, huh?
17 running up in Mickey D's begging for a double cheese, huh,
Singing "I don't want to grow up don't nobody like you when your 23"
I came from nothing but a fucking unsupportive father I don't ever see,
I had to watch a crooked jury put my brother in the penitentiary,
I never fit in.
Criticism, made me the man I couldn't be,
I'm reminiscing on when life was different spending every day at Chuckee Cheese, uh


We live on front porches and swing life away,
We get by just fine here on minimum wage,
If love is a labor I'll slave till the end,
And I'll run these streets if you give me a chance,


I've been here so long,
Maybe I should runaway,
Try to find a summer day,
What is love,
Love is pain,
Love is butterflies and stomach aches,
Love is looking out a windowpane, tears dripping looking like you're in the rain,
For someone you don't even know but for somebody you may never see again,
I am only alive once,
And I'm a die when God wants,
So fill the sky with diamonds,
Because that's how it's gonna look when I'm gone,
Had a vision as a kid that one day I would change the world with my song,
Several years have passed and now that vision came to life that boy's a fucking icon,




Sometimes I don't want to fucking wake up,
When all they want to do is bring me down,
And all the things I've went through as I came up,
Are the fucking reasons why I run this town,


We live on front porches and swing life away,
(And to my fans, I told you)
We get by just fine here on minimum wage,
If love is a labor I'll slave till the end,
And I'll run these streets if you give me a chance,
We live on front porches and swing life away,
(All my dreamers)
We get by just fine here on minimum wage,
(Stay real)
If love is a labor I'll slave till the end,
(And to my love)
And I'll run these streets if you give me a chance,
(Stay here)
Swing life away,
(What we do)
Swing life away,
(And what we do)
Swing life away,
(Yeah)
Swing life away,
(And we just)
Swing life away,
(Let's swing life away)
Swing life away,
(Let's swing life away)
Swing life away,
(Let's swing life away)
Swing life away.
