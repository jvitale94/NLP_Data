When the fuck you gonna grow up?
When that money gonna show up?
Thought that 10 Day shit would blow up
Got you stressed ripping yo fro up
Smokin squares fuckin your throat up
And a nigga from your iPod in the party and they know ya
And your teachers wanna claim ya
They critically acclaiming
Used to criticize your mistakes
Mr. Bennett's Mr. Famous
Mrs. Rownd just heard your mixtape
A misogynistic mischief
You the reason for the mishaps
You should keep coming up missing
You're a Top Dog
You the top dog
They can't even catch up
You so hot-dog
And it feels good, and it feels dope
You still steal shit, cause you still broke
And you really wanna drop, really really hot
Shit that they really wanna cop, but they wouldn't give a fuck
If you win a grammy or if you end up in the hall of rock
Then you end up in a hole from a hammy to the top


Got 99 problems. Got a 100 to the drugs
I should finish up this verse but you know I don't give a fuck. YOLO!


Yo-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
YOLO 


Shouts out my Juice, bitch
My cup runneth over
Bout now them suits fit my cuffs button golden
So bitch suck my dick igh
Bitch suck my dack
I been riding around in that steamer
With that steamer in my lap
I swear I used to give a fuck
But now I give a fuck less
What do I think of success?
What do you think of fuck fest!
You ever had a four-some?
You ever been a suspect?
You ever passed the fuck out?
You ever failed a drug test?
I learned from getting bumped and bumping Ye could make it be OK
All that jumping, dunking shit can't make a 3 go away
I been up inside the stu' for fuckin' 3 whole days
Yellin fuck the cops, it ain't nothing to box
Somebody pour me another shot
Like SHOTS, SHOTS, SHOTS, SHOTS, SHOTS, SHOTS, SHOTS, SHOTS, SHOTS, SHOTS
Drop, Drop, Drop, Drop
Give a fuck... Fuck That, That
Is you Going, dot, dot, dot? like a lot, lot, lot, lot
Do the fop, bop, bop, bop, Don't Stop, Stop, Stop, Stop
Who gon' stop me?
