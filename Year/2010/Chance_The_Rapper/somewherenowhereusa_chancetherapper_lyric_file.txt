

I'm in the middle of nowhere, nowhere, nowhere
And I'm just looking for somewhere, somewhere, somewhere
Yeah, you like that, how I did my own echo cause no one else can do me but me cause I'm the best though
I'm a bag of kush, you're bagged oregano
And I've been this way from the get-go, get low
Mistaking me for him is like geico for geco
When they replace me for me money and some background techno
Anyways so I don't toy with kids just to let know
And all y'all still playing on the blocks need to let go
Difference between us, lies in genetic make up
X-y chronology, body mass, make-up
At night I sleep, all night you stay up 
You're afraid of nightmares, I'm afraid to wake up
And I tell my girl I love her every time I see her 
Cause I'm afraid tomorrow that I might not be here
Cause sometimes my wrist whispers "slit us,
And we'll wisp ya to the other side of wisdom”
Just jump off the tip of the worlds tallest building
Fall on the tracks in a plane that you tripped up or slip up
Pop pills blame it was a mix up
"oh the box said 2-4, coulda swore that it read 24"
Damn Chance you coulda died if you popped anymore
Damn, just 1 more coulda let me go where 
Maybe god intended me to grow here
Damn Chano, keep spacing off I swear you so weird
You're afraid of somewhere, I'm content with nowhere


Somewhere, nowhere, USA
Aye aye aye aye
Somewhere, nowhere USA
Aye aye
Somewhere, nowhere

You can go to somewhere to nowhere by trolley from Maui to Mali
Mexican tamales on the border
And Milan between crazy and depressed
Maybe I'm just stressed cause my damsel’s not undressed
And her knight in shining armor is searching for martyr 
Like playing a game of operation with Parkinson’s 
You touched the walls and you felt shocked
Cause when you touched the walls 
You felt boxed
Nowhere is vast and somewhere is compressed 
And my dreams need room to stretch out its legs
And it can run around for miles when its with itself
With even more stride than the gum itself
I feel my sanity is picking on my fantasies
And reality is pulling out the man in me 
But drive, could give a shit about your asthma 
Just kick you in the ass and tell you to run faster
And some weeks have passed since I last seen my pastor
And let him tell me I don’t get anything I ask for
God’ll give you wings if you stop being a bastard 
I guess I’ll go to nowhere I don’t need to pass but…
