These mutha fuckas so I'm just like yeah 


Please tah meet ya find me with ah heep of reefa 
Speaking etha ill whoop ya ass and crease ya sneakers 
Hatas keep tha haten lil faggots figure skaten 
While we figure eightin seekin ur replace ment and I ain't gon
Touch tha hate like some bacteria 
Some nasty ass food from tha cafateria
You'll have and hear me bruh if u pass me up ah luh 
Ima beat ya ass tearin u in half and eat ya up 
Like any given friday I roll up to ya drive way rock
U in tha face have u lookin sideways 
So step back cause u ain't want it with Mac tha young
Cat with rap to leave u flat on ur back 
And as ah matter of fact I'm like crack on tha track
With mah cap to tha back I'm tha cat in tha hat 
Yeah we rhymen like Dr.Suesus so be careful before u end up on tha news
Everytime that we..


CRUISE like we ain't got nothing to loose 
Hit tha speech throught tha speakers hope its comen in smooth
When we CRUISE see I ain't got nothing to do 
So ima roll around tha city smoken blunts with mah crew
When we CRUISE 


And there ain't nobody that do it like Pittsburg (NOPE)
Said there ain't nobody do it like Pittsburg (NOT AH)
I said it twice just incase that u misheard
Cause this verse is like........
So quit ya back talk I ain't haven it boy
I'm lookin fresh right now straight dazzlen boy
Light a swisher now I'm gone
When my minds on, 5's on, laced up, headed out the time bomb
Get your life right size truck whit a white light
Triple x tee and a fresh pair of white nikes
I wright like nobody you've seen
Cause my weed is purple and my money is green
See I'm hungry for cream with my fitted on lean
If you wanna talk shit, ima shit on your teaam 
I rock my fitted to the side
Roll around the city blowing piff up in the sky 
When we..


CRUISE like we ain't got nothing to loose

The kid raps like lasers, sharp like rasors
Rollin up my weed and someÂ ?gos see a vegas? (yuup)
Fuck a cop tryna chase me with tasers,
I'm runnin out my crib and I'm dippin through the neighbors, garden
High homie marvin the marshin
I wipe my ass with you soft rappers like charmin
Yall hungry I'm starvin, you talkin shit, oh I beg your pardon
Specifics is never gimics,
I rip it just how I live it,
You wanna it ill go and get, I'm kickin it so escuisit
The wickedest mothafucka on the block I live at
Shit talk on hip hop I'm pealing your wig back, yuup
So where the crib at, where the party at,
Where them butt naked hoes and the bacardi at
Cause when I start to rap, its gameova
And I ain't spend a single one sober
When we..
