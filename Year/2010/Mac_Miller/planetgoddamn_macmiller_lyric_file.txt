Reminded of the times when this love was so divine
But now it's feelin' like without ya
Feelin' like how the fuck did
We get into a place we ain't accustomed to lovin' inside of
I know I'm out of my mind more often than not
You know I'm used to givin' this all that I got, yeah
It's not a waste when that smile on your face
You tell me you are the place, you parked in my spot
Okay, baby with this piece of cake
We could lay up on the beach, you could feed me grapes
It's my favorite song,  spin it till the needle breaks
We could quit the whole game, do the real estate
Things how you beat the case
Put in work, turn that pussy to the office
Be on top of your game cause you're a goddess
Now I ain't here to break a promise
I'm just tryna keep it honest, and honestly


Tell the truth, tell the truth, tell truth
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Show me you, show me you, show me you
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Tell the truth, tell the truth, tell the truth
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Show me you, show me you, show me you
Na-na-na-na-na-na


Okay, no mishaps, this, that, and the third
Don't go back on my word, yeah I keep that shit gift wrapped
Your pussy a ride better than Six Flags, I'm in that
No take aways, no give backs
No question, we've been through adolesence
And change of direction, yeah I paid attention to it
It's never been easy but now it's gettin' ruthless
A little more pain, that's just better music
Girl what's on your brain? Cause that head is stupid
Lotta people suck a dick, but you can execute it
Perfect timing, don't you ever add another second to it
Don't you ever-ever-ever-ever-ever do it
Yeah, head pollution, conflict resolution
Keep it true, everything that I do with you
I ain't here to break a promise
I'm just tryna keep it honest, and honestly


Tell the truth, tell the truth, tell truth
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Show me you, show me you, show me you
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Tell the truth, tell the truth, tell the truth
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Show me you, show me you, show me you
Na-na-na-na-na-na


You don't have to protect me
We both know how it ends
I just need your presence
Wanna feel you feel me
(You just landed from the Planet God damn)
Wanna feel you feel me
Wanna feel you feel me
(You just landed from the Planet God damn)
Wanna feel you feel me
Wanna feel you feel me
