The drinks stay cold when we coolin coolin
And being broke starts to get a little old
My money had to get some fine tunin
Tonight might be the night I make it
So let's live it up and don't regret it at all
All these faces, different places
People hit me up but I'm forgetting to call
Get laid in California when the weather gettin colder
Or honeys by the pool 
Chillen on the beach house, lounging by the sofa
Riding with a chauffeur, on my way to blow up
Roll up, fishing, champagne sipping
5-star chefs stay cooking in the kitchen but only making that good shit
See the way I'm living they like oh my goodness

I tell em I'm fine
I ain't got a damn thing on my mind
And baby all we got is time
Let's just watch the clouds go by

And there ain't no need to panic
Girl we can lay up on this hammock
