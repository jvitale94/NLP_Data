I didn't mean to pull the trigger, I swear (I swear)
But now she's dead and there ain't no coming back once you there (there)
I hope she knew that I loved her, I hope she knew that I cared (I cared)
Your food getting cold, why don't you come sit down in this chair (chair)
We can talk about all the things we should have done
All the arguments that you probably would have won (have won)
But I'm stubborn baby, you knew that when you told me you loved me
And I told you I loved you back (loved you back)
But now you laying on the tile, I'm waiting for a smile
So I'll stay here for a while, when the cops come in
They're gonna have to take me away (away)


And I'll tell em, "I'm sorry
I didn't mean to do it"
Guess I'm just emotional
And maybe kinda stupid
I just wanna hold you close
So why do I have to give you away

And I'll tell em, I'm sorry
I'm not a bad person
I couldn't take your pain away
I guess I'm undeserving
But if I cant have you to myself
Then you're, gone (gone)




I didn't mean to pull the trigger, I swear (I swear)
Life full of surprises, but that shit isn't fair (isn't fair)
Tell me how we live is different, guess this shit kinda rare (rare)
If you getting cold, why don't you come sit down in this chair (chair)
We can talk about everything you hate on this Earth (Earth)
And that you're getting tired, cause you making it work (work)
But can I kiss you just one more time (time)
Baby lemme close your eyes, feel your lips touching mine (touching mine)
I'm sure I've never seen you look more heavenly (heavenly)
Now I'm rubbing on your back, whispering rest in peace (rest in peace)
It's okay baby, go to sleep (go to sleep)
I'll keep you safe, you alone with me 
Say I wouldn't hurt you, I lied
I don't deserve you, I tried
So I'm a stay by your side (side)
But when the cops come in
They're gonna have to take me away (away)


And I'll tell em, "I'm sorry
I didn't mean to do it"
Guess I'm just emotional
And maybe kinda stupid
I just wanna hold you close
So why do I have to give you away

And I'll tell em, I'm sorry
I'm not a bad person
I couldn't take your pain away
I guess I'm undeserving
But if I cant have you to myself
Then you're, gone (gone)
