That high gloss, that high gloss
You see that glow, that high gloss
That high gloss, that high gloss
Here we go…


I fuck around with them playmates
Twenty thousand my day rate
Eating seven course meals now
People say that I gained weight
All you rappers you ain’t safe
More money same face
Been the shit still the shit
Just double up, exchange rate
Guess who just grown up now
You can all sit the fuck down
Had to speak to P, said I need the beat
To show these clowns I don’t fuck around
Asking me about money, wonder what’s my net worth
People try to come sue me, but I call up J.G. Wentworth
Yeah I glow, they don’t
I suppose let ‘em go
Spend 10 racks on my coat
Fuck a whip just bought me a boat
My flow is gross
Be bread, get it I was toast
Without one, you reaching
You ain't close, get it, no


Oh you ain’t now (oh you ain’t now)
Since I was born (since I was born)
My mind was gone (my mind was gone)
Know I was poor
Don’t mind any bitch I just go (I just go)
And my wrist was cold (wrist was cold)
My world was snow (my world was snow)
What I need light fo’
Girl I’m white as a bitch, I just glow
I’m so special (I’m so special)
I’m so special (I’m so special)
I’m so special (I’m so special)
Girl I’m white as a bitch I just glow
I’m so special (I’m so special)
I’m so special (I’m so special)
I’m so special (I’m so special)
Girl I’m white as a bitch I just glow


I rap a lot, rap a lot, don’t be afraid it’s just after shock
Yeah jam like when Shaq grab the rock
I’m going in like a Magic shot
Don’t rap sweet like apricots
Shut the fuck up you don’t have to talk
I’ma lay back with my ass on top
Got the game on match a lot muthafucker
You don’t see cash a lot, bitch stop acting like you bad you not
I put my dick in her ass and twat and she look back like thats the spot
Call me, I’m counting money, play around with money
Y’all ain’t shit without ya money
Life ain't all about the money
Well it kinda is if you out of money
Mac Millions that’s the name
Most dope that’s the game
Drunk bitch so glad you came
Saw her taking off her clothes tryin have the train
Hoes love us, tryna fuck us with no rubbers
Fuck that, we fuck each other, on tour we make her fuck the runner
Muthafucker just shit you need
You ain’t fuck around my team
Cause you living all of your dreams
Here to kill your self esteem
And my flow is pyro
Smoke blunts 'til my eyes close
Middle finger up high though
End this song on a high note



I’m just eating that pink slime
Bitch that pink slime
Muthafuckerrrrrrr...!!!
