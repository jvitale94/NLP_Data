


Dealing with everybody’s opinion
Trying to do me
Only down one, I’m in the final
Shooting threes
Like I don’t give a fuck
Music we fuck, switch the position up
We love the things that keep on
Bringing out the kids in us
Been working all my life to do some different stuff
and people have the nerve to say I’m young and haven’t lived enough
I’m on the road, my girl so sad I’m gone
It’s hard when I can’t even find the time to call my mom
When she thinks I’m going Hollywood
I guess she probably should
It seems like people see the bad and don’t acknowledge good
I feel the shade but I can see the sun, it’s cool
I got the time to feel the need to run, a fool
Is what I’ve become, young and I’m dumb
Been spending cake to get some bump in the trunk
Drums with a pump like some Reeboks
See me from the treetops
They worry but they need not
Heating like a teapot
Now I think I’m cool cause I got a pair of shoes
A more dough, a jacket with a Polo logo
My cup always filled with Henny
So no Four Loco
They should know, so..
I could go slow, you see that I’m smooth now
Used to ignore me
They study what I do now
With some help from Kweli
And it’s Like on the they
Its cool to say my cypher complete


Word. I’m so sick with the verbs I use
The words to heal us
They love how I kill it on stage, man
Murder theaters
No wonder they call it a book asleep in the coffin
Dead tired
Exhausted from how often I be touring
So gangsta, Like the occupation of Made Men
Creating chaos, my operation is Mayhem
The movie never stopped the frame changeover
We add a Mac to the wolfpack: hangover
That Hen is not a friend
I’m on that Lager ?
Whatever substance, I abuse it like a grown man
I’m not a kid no more
Don’t want to hold your hand that four loco
make you shoulder lean like a dro fan,
Go ham, like Abraham reading all the signs
Oh yeah, and don’t forget to call your moms
Same thing I told Bow Wow last year
Take care of the fam
Cause it’s all we really have here..
