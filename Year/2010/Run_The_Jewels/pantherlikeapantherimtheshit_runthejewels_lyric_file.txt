Said that God was a brother
I said if you believe 
Then you would want me to fuck her
I walk around in a bubble
A fucking scoundrel in trouble
And there be times make her fumble 
And then they rhyme in the rubble


I'm the shit
Looking at the money like it's mine to get
I'm the shit bitch
Everybody down, throw the pistol and fist
I'm the shit
Looking at the money like it's ours to get
I'm the shit bitch
Everybody lies throw the pistol and fist


They be the grimey and greedy
Made it to Grammy's and they eat it
Got told that we 


I'm the shit
Looking at the money like it's mine to get
I'm the shit bitch
Everybody lies throw the pistol and fist
I'm the shit
Looking at the money like it's ours to get
I'm the shit bitch
Everybody lies throw the pistol and fist
I'm the shit
