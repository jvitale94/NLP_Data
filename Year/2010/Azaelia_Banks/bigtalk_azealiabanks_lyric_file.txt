Bring your sexy ass in here
All I know is that big talk
All I know is that big talk
All I know is that big talk
Banks!
(Maybach Music)

All I know is that big talk
Gold rings
Got gold buttons going up and down my sheep skin
We the wolf pack and it's a cold summer
Never deep, I keep one-gunna
Say her name I might run up on ya
Send that text "I wanna touch ya girl"
If they don't fuck with us, well, it's fuck the world
Ice box for my princess
Got a double M on that pendant
And back in, I'm bout to spend that
Got a big bag and I've been rich
We make love and she talk slick
G-Wagon, she a boss bitch
Major League and that boy pissed
Major League and that boy pissed
Mussolini when I'm out in Rome
Cleopatra, She dipped in gold
Pussy shots she send my phone
Bel-Air, my mind blown
Rozay and I'm checking out
Like Caesar did
Slide down the sword
She a  she love God
Pray you never let her come crucify the boy


Black magic, David Blaine flow
Colour money like a rainbow
Azealia Banks keep the bank roll
Shine like illuminated Angels
Bad bitch, I'm bodacious
Black power but I'm no racist
Balling out, don't need no eight
And the Maybach feelin' so spacious
Focused on another hundred thou
Going up another level now
Nigga's wildin', better settle down
Got the Rollie diamonds in the bezzle now
Take notes, get your pen and pencil
With Ricky Ross, we quintessential
Ain't nothing here incidental
We poppin' off on instrumentals
Slide off in the Rolls Royce
I'm slaying bitches in the great mink
He slide on it like escapades
This ice on me like a skating rink
Big talk, big bank
Pussy wetter than the Great Lakes
And for this life, I'mma give thanks
And pray they never gon' burn a witch at the stake


All I know is that big talk
All I know is that big talk
This conversation is rich talk niggas
All I know is that big talk
