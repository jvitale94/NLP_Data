This about to be another jam on the reals
You can dance if you're with it put your game on stills
But you can't can't slip it while the dance on shills
Saw your man, I should meet him and your man toss chips
Went to France on a visa, a hundred grand for the trip
When I lean I could greet him with then lamb on a strip
Little bambs with for the visa for the game and the fit
Damn little diva you're the champ, you're the shit,
You're the glam, and the glitz, you're a vamp you're a bitch
Listen up my nigga, you're a fan, you a trick
You be amp to the spits with ya man's in the whip
And I heard you're rich, heard you're "rich nigga" rich
Heard your click, had to lick
Can you stick to the bricks
And if it splits get your cran in your tips
Put your hand on your dick
Take a gander at this


High you been on my mind, you been on my eyes,
Realize this
Show me, show, show me one time
Right, and even your right the look in your eyes
I like it,
Won't you just show me one time
Uh, uh, uh


I'm everywhere you can't go
I'm everywhere you wish you could
I'm sussed up in that Van Vogue
My weave long and my pussy good
I lift it up, and I tip it slow
That chocolate body that tootsie roll
That flirty Hershey, lawda mercy
Do it to me, don't hurt me, hurt me
Rollie polie, float your boatie
Dick it up it's so swolely swolely
Swolely swolely, he holdin' holdin'
He packin' pack and I'm throwing back
And I'm counting racks while he lick the crack
If he acting up then he gettin slapped
If I pop the trunk, then he gettin clapped
I'll pop ya rump and I'll split your back


High you been on my mind, you been on my eyes,
Realize this
Show me, show, show me one time
Right, and even your right the look in your eyes
I like it,
Won't you just show me one time
Uh, uh, uh


Can I get that
Can I get that whip
Can I take that trip
Can I get that grip
Can I split that chip where my bitch pat
Where my rich cat,
Will you keep that shit when you hit that strip
When you hit that scene, and the scene get a tan
And a six pack, where my bitch pack
Where'd you get them clothes
How you make that roll, how you make that dose
Sip it slow, sip it slow, sip it, sit back
Quit the chit chat
Before I rip that bow, when I rip your soul
When I rip that bow


High you been on my mind, you been on my eyes,
Realize this
Show me, show, show me one time
Right, and even your right the look in your eyes
I like it,
Won't you just show me one time
Uh, uh, uh
