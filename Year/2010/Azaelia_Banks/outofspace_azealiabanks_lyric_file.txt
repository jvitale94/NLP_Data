I take your brain in a parallel universe trip
I'm the only no paralel bitch
Things running and shit, maneuvered in deep
Then I murder you and you spit
Get your little outdated frozen a hip
On the word click click
How much is for this clip
Blast it off last 'er, you might be stuck on this dick
Look at this bitch, tick tick
What you do, wanna get hit hit
Four fifth move quick, four fifth's in the whip
What dimension is this


I'm gonna send him to outer space, to find another race
I'm gonna send him to outer space, to find another race
I'm gonna send him to outer space, to find another race
I'm gonna send him to outer space, to find another race
Pay close attention
I take your brain to another dimension
I take your brain in a parallel universe trip
I'm the only no paralel bitch
Things running and shit, maneuvered in deep
Then I murder you and you spit
Get your little outdated frozen a hip
On the word click click


Close attention
Yo what's up Neutron
Giving you money what planet you flew from
I've been pressing the hard rock
Promise group on
Cosmos kitchens, known as the New York
Out of world witch, breakers and new borns
Space ships push the roof on
Platform boots hanging out the coop door
Out of the world bitch, chicks a new born
Every little pun errupt a new song
I'm ahead of your shaky shoe show
ET phone room full of photon
Ever since, no need for the blues off
Keep on, the feening, the feen off
The fews go finally speed off
Here to take you higher than leeloo
Bounce off, casanova libra


Pay close attention
Pay close attention
Pay close attention
Pay close attention
I take your brain to another dimension
I take your brain to another dimension
