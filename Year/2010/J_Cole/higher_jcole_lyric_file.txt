Tryna bag a brother with a Super Bowl ring
Oh she, down in Dallas at the all-star game spittin' all-star game
Tryna get a nigga with a all-star name
Somethin' like James, somethin' like Wade
If you something like K you can fuck tonight

You're old nigga act like a bitch like Tyler Perry
You caught him down in Memphis cheating like Kale Perry
I see you like to stay up on your ESPN
If your mind is on sex, you must got ESP then
Had a crush on way back, I wasn't VIP then
But I was plottin on you
I really wished that I had got to know you
Before we grew up & I blew up with these Benjamines
That way I know for sure, you're love is really genuine
