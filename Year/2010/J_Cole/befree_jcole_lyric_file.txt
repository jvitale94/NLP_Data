

And I'm in denial
And it don't take no x-ray to see right through my smile
I know, I'd be on the go
And it ain't no drink out there that can numb my soul
No, no

All we want to do is take the chains off
All we want to do is break the chains off
All we want to do is be free
All we want to do is be free
All we want to do is take the chains off
All we want to do is break the chains off
All we want to do is be free
All we want to do is be free

Can you tell me why every time I step outside
I see my niggas die,
Ooh, I'm letting you know
That it ain't no gun they make that can kill my soul
Oh, no

All we want to do is take the chains off
All we want to do is take the chains off
All we want to do is be free
All we want to do is be free
All we want to do is take the chains off
All we want to do is break the chains off
All we want to do is be free
All we want to do is be free

Are we all alone fighting on our own
Please give me a chance
I don't wanna dance
Something's got me down
I will stand my ground,
Don't just stand around
Don't just stand around

All we want to do is take these chains off
All we want to do is break the chains off
All we want to do is be free
All we want to do is be free

All we want to do is take these chains off
All we want to do is break the chains off
All we want to do is be free
All we want to do is be free
