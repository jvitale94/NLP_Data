Sometimes I brag like Hov
(Born sinner)
Sometimes I brag like Hov
(Born sinner)
Sometimes I brag like Hov
(Born sinner)
Sometimes I brag like Hov
(Now I'm in the limelight cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade)


Sometimes I brag like Hov', sometimes I'm real like Pac
Sometimes I focus on the flow to show the skills I got
Sometimes I focus on the dough, look at these bills I got
This is a message for some rappers tryna steal my spot
You niggas famous on the internet, I'm real life hot
Homie, get your weight up, fake niggas get sprayed up
My verbal AK slay faggots and I don't mean no disrespect
Whenever I say faggot, okay faggot? huh, don't be so sensitive
If you want to get fucked in the ass
That's between you and whoever else's dick it is, pause
Maybe that line was too far
Just a little joke to show how homophobic you are
And who can blame ya? Boy Meets World
I'm trying to find a new Topanga
And bang her out, no hangin' out
My pop's was club hopping back when Rick James was out
And all I get is Trinidad James, wait a minute that's strange
Sip a bit of champagne, say "fuck"
If the hoes like it, I love it nigga nigga nigga
Used to watch Rap City Big Tigga Tigga
Rap nerd even copped Rah Digga Digga
Pac had a nigga saying "Fuck Jigga, fuck Biggie"
I was only like eleven so forgive me
A decade later I be all up in the city
Tryna get Hov to fuck with me
With a burned CD full of jams that was up in my hand
When he said he didn't want it, it was "Fuck him again"
One day, he gon' regret playing me
Little did I know, in a year he'd be fucking paying me
What can you say to me, I beat the odds like Vegas
I use to rap about haters before niggas was hating me
Now they hate to see a young black man with a college degree
Fucking all these little models for free, pardon me


Sometimes I brag like Hov
(Born sinner)
Sometimes I brag like Hov
(Born sinner)
Sometimes I brag like Hov
(Born sinner)
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Got game back
I ain't ever letting go


I'm prince of the city, I studied Machiavelli
You niggas couldn't blow with C4 strapped to your belly
I snuck up out the parks where niggas be living heartless
And cannot tell the difference between Iraqi, Israeli
So I'm on the really, what could you actually tell me?
I'm tryna keep my homie from throwing crack in the skully
So, back with this pen to give back for my sins
Took a black president to tell the Japanese "Sorry"
But who the fuck gon' tell my niggas "sorry"?
Never seen his pops cause he's sorry
Fuck the education, would ask for reparations
But I'm probably just gonna buy Ferraris (Vroom)
Please forgive him
According to the preacher man he needs Jesus in him
But the Devil run the TV so the demons in him, I'm in trouble
Did a deal with the Devil but now I'm pleading with him
Like give me my soul


My nigga
I ain't ever letting you go again
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again
Please give me my soul
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again
Please give me my soul
I ain't ever letting go
But the Devil don't play fair

I'm bout to go and join the Illuminati
Fuck everybody
I'm bout to go and join the Illuminati
Fuck everybody
I'm bout to go and join the Illuminati
Fuck everybody
I'm bout to go and join the Illuminati


These next three bars is dedicated to the retards
Keep on asking me about the Illuminati
Is you stupid nigga? Young black millionaire
Old white billionaires, I'm sure that they could do without me
And I ain't really into sacrificing human bodies
Couple more A's I would have been a summa cuma lade
Beyonce told me that she want to cop the new Bugatti
That shit is more than what I'm worth, I think she knew it probably
Well this is awkward (awkward),
Want to know what else is really awkward (awkward)?
When niggas buy rings for bitches that have flings
When I'm praying I don't see them at the Oscars

Re-adjusted my target audience, cause it's obvious
I've gone astray, losing my way
Like Timberlake produced by Timberland
On that goddamn Futuresex Lovesounds
What's playing in my mind? Just the sound of my whole career
Crashing burning, the thing that I mostly fear
Was on track for the first two years
Until I let the Devil steer, now what have we here?
Now I got to mask my tears, but I


I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again


Allow me to re-introduce myself, my name is Cole
My nigga
(Born sinner)
Sometimes I brag like Hov
