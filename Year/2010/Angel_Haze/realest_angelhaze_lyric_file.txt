Fuck that bitch the realest
Middle fingers up,
It's like motherfuck your feelings
I said thriller than the thrillest
Fuck that bitch the realest


Ok I'm nr.1 tell who tack it
I'm back up on my shi-shi-shit
Suicidal self got a minute like
Back off my wrist wrist wrist
My team is too exclusive
Your team is full of actors
Bitch I'm a fucking movement
Yeah I'm practically the casher
We might be out in Vegas
Next week we in Tabago
I swear we fucking hungry bitch,
We eating off your table
Got a mend all the plane
And the skit's so plain
Money on my mind and the shit gon' rain
Whole bunch of bitches tryin ' to do it like I can
But you do it like I can but the shit's so lame
Your shit so lame to get like me
You gotta twist your brain
Bitch twist your sane,
If your shit's hash, my shit's cocaine
My shit cocaine, don't pay no mind, my shit no brain
My shit so edgie, shit so classic,
I wonder that's my shit so vain
Y'all niggas don't understand,
Must be one of my ass like underpants
And I'm over y'all ass like smuddering
And I'm smuddering and I'm covering
I'm covering my tracks,
Telling bitches that I watch their back
Tell 'em hoes I'm about my money
Tell 'em bitches better have my stacks oh


Thriller than the thrillest
Fuck that bitch the realest
Middle fingers up,
It's like motherfuck your feelings
I said motherfuck your feelings
I'm realer than the realest
Middle fingers up bitches
Motherfuck your feelings


Like off in the world I was made to shine
And I'm about to blow up like it rains inside me
Y'all low motherfuckers that the way you talk
And everything I spit, hot like Satans alive
The greatness, they less I'm awesome peak
And I don't wanna wait bitch, Dawson's Creek
Thinking I put us together, we are not conjuction
Think you looking like a male bitch, high consumption
Way too many screws lose connected like bluetooth
Writing on a patch bitch connected like blues clues
True girl, and yeah I'm nasty like school flu
Realest and the latest looking at me like who's who
Damn they looking at me like, who's who?
Bitch, I'm looking at you like, who you?
I know I'm the best digging anybody's grave
I ain't next to nobody, I'm the first in your haze nigga


Thriller than the thrillest
Fuck that bitch the realest
Middle fingers up,
'Cause it's motherfuck your feelings
I said motherfuck your feelings
I'm realer than the realest
Middle fingers up bitches
Motherfuck your feelings
