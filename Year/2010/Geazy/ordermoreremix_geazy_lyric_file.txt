I'm popping champagne, now I'm pouring more
I just ran out of ones it's time to order more
So if you want this cash you gotta show some more
That private dance is through that corridor, let's go
I'm off drugs and a bunch of shots
After party at my crib with a bunch of thots
So order more bottles don't care what the cost
My neighbor is a bitch they tried to call the cops, you bitch
Fuck you I'm living life, all good don't need advice
Pussy is my favorite vice, I see you I get enticed
Them titties nice, tonight I'm a hit it twice
Coming home on that Bay Bridge
Two AM on them city nights, yeah




Keep a bag, blow a bag, throw a bag it ain't nothing
I'm the weatherman, thunderstorm, forecast whole hundred
Don't want no model girl, I want a baller girl
And you want a baller girl, and I'm right here balling girl
I'm a send you an Uber, and she from Aruba
She know nothing about this thug life, she like what is a shooter?
Took her down in Miami, put that bitch on a scooter
Took her striaght to the phantom too
I know just how to do her
She said she had a man, but she know how to maneuver
She give me head underwater so I'm a call her my scuba
Doubt, Rolls Royce on deck, travel
Shawtie's ass so fat, rattle
Told a bitch I love her, liar
Waitress all out of ones, fired
I got old money I can return with it
Tryna fuck a check up now ain't tryna die with it
Money bag, money bag
Got a whole bunch of stacks got a whole lotta ass
If for her I just might




I'm about to order some more money
Just to throw it at her
That money doesn't matter
I'll make it back ma√±ana
I hit it like a batter
I make it rat-a-tat-a
I never give her answers, I never give her data
Mama she a dancer, she dance her fucking ass off
She take her fucking pants off, and dance her fucking ass off
She let me feel that ass off
Charge it to my black card
She fucked me for that iphone she so tired of that android
An outdoor person having orogies in my backyard
I think her ass got steriods, this dick feel like heroin
Lil Tunechi don't ease in lord, but I had to expand lord
Charging on these niggas got them looking for some tan oil
I got all these bands boy, these hoes call me band boy
Weezy F. Band boy stay in pussy, not the tabloids
And just to think I was the bag boy
Now I got that bag boy, I got coupon alloys
Just order some more cash boy
Just order some more cash boy
