Outta pocket
You know what you doctored in



Ummmm-My fan base is a mixture
Of slutty blonde girls, pot smokers and blixsters
Each and every night I have the wildest adventures
Like fingering your sister
'Til my fucking wrist hurts
Here, want to see? I took a picture
Friends call me G
But see- you can call me Mister
My songs play on iPods, phones, and transistors
Chugging on the Brass Monkeys
This is my elixir
A household name- I'm a fixture
You're spending money on these bitches, you're a trickster
That's cause you really need to hurry up and fix ther
Atta dude, "you're acting outta pocket" that should fix her


Outta pocket
You know what you doctored in

Outta pocket (Actin dumb, bitch you)



Chippy on the mic
Like you in a fucking retrograde
MC Chippy, yo this pussy's like a razor blade
Call me when you gettin' paid
Yo I'm free, mind if you do it
Your producers like "haters be hatin'"
Licky lick lick lick
One time that's slutty too
Macon
Bake this
Jump off the nigga stick
Flow so sexy, it'll make you wanna stir
Flow so sexy, it'll make you wanna stir
