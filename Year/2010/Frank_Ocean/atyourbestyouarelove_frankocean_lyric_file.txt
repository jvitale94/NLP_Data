Sometimes it's hard to tell you so
You may not be in the mood to learn
What you think you know
There are times when I find
You wanna keep yourself from me
When I don't have the strength
I'm just a mirror of what I see

But at your best you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
If you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know
(Luhh) Let me know

When you feel what you feel
It's hard for me to understand
So many things have taken place before this love affair began
But if you feel more like I feel
Confusion can give way to doubt
For there are times when I fall short of what I say
What I say I'm all about

But at your best you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
If you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know
(Luhh) Let me know

(Wait, waiting)
Let me know
You niggas goin' in
Tell me what it is
(Fuck it)
What it is, no need to make believe
Look beyond your world, try to find, find a place for me

Cause when you're at your best you are love, you're a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know
Let me know, know

Stay at your best baby
Let me know, let me know
Gonna be somebody
Oh I follow
Oh and it's so cloudy
I see the light
Dance tonight
A life I never knew
Tell me what you need from me?
Gas money?
And I did what I needed to
To become
Hope the water's deep enough
We've been here before
First time is not the best time
I ain't felt this way in years
First I was rushing forward
This time I'm waiting for the rush
Infatuation's a rush
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Keep pushing on
Never let it stop
Oh I miss a beat
Bind all of us to him
I love the way you make me feel
Me, you and, you and me
I wake up in a week
Wake me up in a week
I won't sit still
I won't sit still
I'm getting used to it
Yeah you're going to get used to it
I love the way you make me feel
