


I seen him buy you a drink
 kissing holding hands
Why you looking at me
I hope that you don't think that he is the only man
That you getting freaky with


When you sleeping at night she's creeping out
It's not you it's us that she's worried about


Tryna help her, help her
She's just taking all your money
She don't love ya, love ya
It's so funny, he's a sucker for love

And I'm sorry for you


Her body's fierce she's like scorpion
Her body said get over here
If I knew she had a man
I can't lie I still would hit it
But I don't really understand
How you blind and you can't see it


When you sleeping at night she's creeping out
It's not you it's us that she's worried about


Tryna help her, help her
She's just taking all your money
She don't love ya, love ya
It's so funny, he's a sucker for love

And I'm sorry for ya


One day you gonna stop and you gonna get caught
Whether you like it or not
You ain't gone get far
One day you gonna fall in love
And someone's gonna break your heart


Tryna help her, help her
She's just taking all your money
She don't love ya, love ya
It's so funny, he's a sucker for love

And I'm sorry for ya
