

It’s 2 am
Got a call
From a girl
You should know
She heard a noise
Got a little scared
Now you of all people know
She hates sleeping alone
But still you ain’t home
So since your nowhere to be found
Don’t trip bro I’ma hold her down

I’m your girlfriend’s best friend
Soon I’ll be taking over
I’m your girlfriend’s best friend
You don’t treat her like you’re supposed to
With your wandering eyes
All your cheating and lying
I’ma step up and do what I gotta
I’m your girlfriend’s best friend
Soon I’ll be taking
Soon-soon I’ll be taking your spot

Now I’m not hating
On your situation
But all I’m saying
These chicks are crazy
You’ve got a good girl
Who’s all about you
It’s gonna take you losing her
For you to know what you really had
On the spotlight, warmin’ her bed
So as soon as you drop the ball
I’ll be ready to pick up where you left off

I’m your girlfriend’s best friend
Soon I’ll be taking over
I’m your girlfriend’s best friend
You don’t treat her like you’re supposed to
With your wandering eyes
All your cheating and lying
I’ma step up and do what I gotta
I’m your girlfriend’s best friend
Soon I’ll be taking
Soon-soon I’ll be taking your spot

To be honest
I ain’t perfect
A saint by no means
But I’m on the outside lookin’ in
And it ain’t a pretty picture by no means
I can push upon it but that ain’t me
I would just sit here and wait my turn

I’m your girlfriend’s best friend
Soon I’ll be taking over
I’m your girlfriend’s best friend
You don’t treat her like you’re supposed to
With your wandering eyes
All your cheating and lying
I’ma step up and do what I gotta
I’m your girlfriend’s best friend
Soon I’ll be taking
Soon-soon I’ll be taking your spot
