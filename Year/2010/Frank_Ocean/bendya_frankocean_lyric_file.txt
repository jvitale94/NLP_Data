(Bend, they bend, they bend, they bend, they bend)
Bend ya up, and bend ya back down
All the girls in my bedroom
(They bend, they bend, they bend, they bend, they bend)
Bend ya in and bend ya in and bend ya back out
All the rules to this game, oh I
(Bend, I bend, I bend, I bend)
Bend it girl, bend it girl


Uhh, soon as I enter
I put a hurtin on it if I don't kill it she injured
For a long time, summer, spring and winter
Fall for anything, you clumsy ass nigga
Jumping off the boat in some eighty-seven locs
She's seen them hundred spokes, and then that woman spoke
But I don't talk back,I put my life on tracks
If that don't work put your wife on track
Show me where the candle wax, it must be you
Because I burn right through everything y'all do
High octane when I bring on my last name
Mr. Lamar a.k.a "The Cash King"
Quicker than pre-cum won't you give her a reason
to not meet/meat up with me like a vegan
Psssh! God Damn I'm the fuckin man
She said fuck her man, now she fuck with man
