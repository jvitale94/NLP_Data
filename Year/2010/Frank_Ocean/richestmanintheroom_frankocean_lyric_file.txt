

Got a heart full of gold, that I own
The clothes on my back and a pant suit
I control my own money
You wouldn't even tell the difference
But I just can't sketch the feeling
I get when you're not home
Or recreate the paintings
You've hung onto my soul


Oh, oh but I bet they're worth millions
Oh, beautiful works of love
Oh, I'm a go to all the fancy places
All the fancy people and
They can't tell me nothing, nothing


Cause they all want what I got
And I ain't got nothing but you
Nothing but you, nothing but you
They can't buy what I got
Cause I ain't got nothing but you
Nothing but you, nothing but you
I'm the richest man in the room
I'm the richest man in the room
I'm the richest man in the room

She got a heart made of glass
What's inside of this like hidden in a bottle
Now what would that be worth in your museum
Recently we traded
And now that hearts my own
And since we're sewed together
I feel like I got both


Oh, and I bet they're worth millions
Oh, beautiful works of love
Oh, I'm a go to all the fancy places
All the fancy people and
They can't tell me nothing, nothing


Cause they all want what I got
And I ain't got nothing but you
Nothing but you, nothing but you
They can't buy what I got
Cause I ain't got nothing but you
Nothing but you, nothing but you
I'm the richest man in the room
I'm the richest man in the room
I'm the richest man in the room

Time itself wants what I got
So I don't care about what you've got
All I know is my girl is special
You make me better, baby
You make me happy, baby
Nobody needs to remind me exactly why I'm
The richest man in the room


Cause they all want what I got
And I ain't got nothing but you
Nothing but you, nothing but you
They can't buy what I got
Cause I ain't got nothing but you
Nothing but you, nothing but you

Cause they all want what I got
And I ain't got nothing but you
Nothing but you, nothing but you
They can't buy what I got
Cause I ain't got nothing but you
Nothing but you, nothing but you
I'm the richest man in the room
I'm the richest man in the room
I'm the richest man in the room
