I wanna ask my momma, but shes been gone for some years now
I need the answers
I want to ask my friends, but their to cool to be honest
And she's gone take it the wrong way if I question her
It just might break her heart man
I can't ask my girl


So I'm gonna ask Lennon
And I'ma ask Donny
And I'ma ask Stevie
And I'ma ask Prince
If I'm in love
If I'm in love

My headphones won't lie if I'm in love
Tell me tell me
If I'm in love

My headphones won't lie if I'm in love
Tell me tell me
Am I in love?


Who the hell knows who Purple Rain is?
And Am I standing in it?
I sing along to every single word though
And I feel like I need them
Cause for all I know
Rocket love flew past me yesterday
But I gotta know for sure

So I'm gonna ask Lennon
And I'ma ask Donny
And I'ma ask Stevie
And I'ma ask Prince
If I'm in love
If I'm in love

My headphones won't lie if I'm in love
Tell me tell me
If I'm in love

My headphones won't lie if I'm in love
Tell me tell me
Am I in love?
