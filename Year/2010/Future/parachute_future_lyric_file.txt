Check her out she hella
Somebody outta tell her
Her ass got a voice
And she sing acapella
I can be the music, pumping in her background
I can make her lose it, and find it in Chi Town
Club of america, legs so tall
I stepped out america
Call it awol
Bitch I am a go getter
That hooks forever
Know ya'll heard that 12 play
That hooks forever
Be the parachute cause I'm falling for that pussy
Be the flashlight cause I'm deep of in that pussy
I been round here, better look round here
Young fella, they call me the king round here
And now I got my voice back, listen round here
I'm the shit, y'all niggas just smell round here
Got them chicks flipping for me, best friends kissing for me
Ay magic city in the back room stripping for me
Your man is like nextel
Soon gone
Girl you can always call on me
Apple phone


Falling (For You) 
Think I need a pa pa pa pa pa 
(Think I need a Parachute
Parachute Parachute) 
Cause I'm going d d down on ya
D d down on ya 


I like yo legs, the way you move
You know gymnastics, I know magic
You know fashion, Emilio
I'm falling for your head, I wanna see u blow
I'm balling on the edge you need a vocal coach
I'm a sky walker, nasa
5 4 3 2 1 I'm bout to blast off
Space rocket, we outta here
You compliment my mojo
You stroking on my ego
You wanna go to pluto
And make movies everyday of your life


Something bout them lashes girl
That really compliments your eyes
There's something about them fishnets girl
That's hugging yet revealing your thighs




Hey, come back, come back, come back, shawty got dat come back
Ondae ondae ondae on on on ondalay
You got me wishing I speak spanish
You got me feeling real mannish
I'm bout to turn up
We set the roof on fire it's bout to burn up
Winding winding winding I see you grinding
Overnight, one night with me and now we shining
I got yo attitude in Venus
I got you begging to catch my semen
Bravo Bravo Bravo, u deserve a Bravo
And you're flyer than a pilot, auto


Something bout them lashes girl
That really compliments your eyes
There's something about them fishnets girl
That's hugging yet revealing your thighs
