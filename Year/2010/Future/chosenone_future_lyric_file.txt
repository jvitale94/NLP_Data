Made a film with them bitches ain’t no one on one
Got this watch and this watch like a 101
All my niggas millionaires it ain’t just one
Had a few chains on, I don’t have but one
Bought a few house and I never sleep at one
And I can have ten cars and I wouldn’t drive one
And when you make it from the bottom you the chosen one


Rich nigga since birth, Louis v chinchilla
Bought a brand new Rover, drive it like a 4 wheeler
Solid gold: AP, flooded out with them crystals
Shinning just like molly, I woke up in a new bugatti
Free lil Kirk Wood, Young Gotti, free my nigga White Boy too
I woke up to a new baby and a spend that on Jimmy Choo
You got goons around you nigga, I keep shooters around me fool
Im a young rich nigga from the bottom I came up and I can’t lose




Guilty by association that’s a lie
How dare you make that accusation I’m an A1 nigga
Check my verification, do whatever to protect my reputation
Make sure you tell em that, multi-faceted business owner hustler
Work pump it up inflation, run your numbers up
Extra point escalation, how you spell dedication
What you know about determination?
Salute the BET, appreciate your nomination
RIAA, appreciate my certification
Got a job for a hater where your application
All that hatin shit, really admiration
