I'm lookin for a bitch
That'll stay down for a nigga through thick and thin
     

Would you ride for yo nigga 
Thats all I wanna know
Would you die for yo nigga (Yea!)
Thats all I wanna know
I'm lookin for a rider, a rider, a rider
I'm lookin for a rider, a rider, a rider


Got a bankroll 
Dubbs I can letcha blow it right now uh? huh?
If everythang fell would run run through the rain, shine, thunderstorms
Would you fuck with the kid where I'm from.. Gotta hold my bong, hold my gun
When days get tight and I come in sweaty, Would you kiss all over me with yo tongue
Would you ride for the kid, would you lie for the kid? Death before dis-honor
When I'm on the road doin shows from mississippi all the way to hong kong
And we made the bond thats ways beyond loui vuitton loui vuitton, don't worry bout the money, the money gone come (Racks!)
I just need to know these two questions
    

Would you ride for yo nigga (Ayee, whatchu lookin for)
Thats all I wanna know
Would you die for yo nigga
Thats all I wanna know
I'm lookin for a rider, a rider, a rider
I'm lookin for a rider (watchu lookin for), a rider, a rider


If some things on my mind I need to get off
Can I come to you?
When I need to talk
If I ever get lost, can you help me find my way back to my vault
Would you cherish yo kid like you never had did
Could you love me? Could you love my kids?
Can you be there for me like you never had been
Like any relationship you ever been in
We make a connection thats full of affection
Can you hold me down, knowin my profession
Will you wait for me patiently, tastefully
Will your loyalty lead to royalty
Can you answer these two questions please


Would you ride for yo nigga
Thats all I wanna know
Would you die for yo nigga
Thats all I wanna know
I'm lookin for a rider, a rider, a rider
I'm lookin for a rider, a rider, a rider
