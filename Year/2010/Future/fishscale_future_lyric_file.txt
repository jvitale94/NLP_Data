All this dope on me, I'm bout to explode,

I had to cook it up myself and bring it all back,
it hit the block every day, nigga run up them stacks, 
he jumped it all he jumped it all like me (like future), nuh-uhhh
our house is a 100 degrees (straight up), where I'm from
I put that kush in my lungs, I count up chips,

work your wrist, cook that fish, 36, in a brick,
get a flock and make a fist, get a pot,
find a bitch, open shop, this ya spot, at her house, trap it out

Bitch I want the yayo, like Boston and Diego (boss),
stacking cake like leggos, all that work is paid for
we cashin out and lay low, pockets in the kitchen,
we'll touch down the ocho, we don't never close,
24, uncold, ice like super bowl, talk to migo,
tell him bring that twerkalator, make sure the fish A-1
make sure this fish, you gotta have that clean when you remix,
I could put a brick together like a puzzle, 
I'm in the middle of the street with j's' in a huddle
my clientele love me, I don't have to touch em,
this money comin in, nigga I can't trust ya,

I burnt up two cell phones, just this week,
I'm startin to work off the boost since my mix-tape got leaked,
it was soft now its hard like concrete under ya feet,
I turned my grandma house to a drug store, we serving all week, 
what ya order is, I pay the water bills (round here), water crystal clear,
dope is out of here, I got that earl malone coke jumping out the gym,
straight drop 
smoke up smoke up smoke up, if you a smoker,
I got that crack for you in my toaster,
if you get too close sir Imma have to roast ya,
have the cash in ya hand when you approach a roller,
