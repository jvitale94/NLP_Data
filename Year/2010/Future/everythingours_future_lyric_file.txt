This that Freebandz shit, you hear me?
Get your money
SCL to ATL


That money bring you power
Good pills and no that powder
We chokin' off that sour
And all this money ours
That money bring you power
Them bills and that powder
We chockin off that sour
And all these bitches ours


I'm leanin' like I'm on a fifth of Henny
I been turned up' like they here from the beginning
I'm in the space, girl, you know sky's not my limit
I keep some racks on me like I be playin' tennis
My girl she wakin' up and she ain't shop at Lennox
She string it out, we at Bell Harbor and we spendin'
I'm in that Lamborghini, no it's not no rented
You see this ice on me and all my windows tinted
She want that Rover, I'm a go and put her in it
I'm like doja, I'm a go and jump up in it
She on that Miley Cyrus ain't nobody business
She told her friends I'm braggin', on her way of hittin' it




I got money, I got power, I was born with respect
I know how them bails look, with your dope I gotta check
Threw 60 on my wrist, 120 round my neck
Just to flex last Sunday, 50 thousand on a bet
30 thousand dollar Rolly, got it draped up in baguettes
20 thousand dollars flights, Freebandz ridin' jets
A lot of rappers get extorted, gotta pay for they respect
We record on gold mics 'cause we don't make nothin' but hits
And I got your bitch with me, she the driver on the licks
Six bricks zone six, niggas 'bout them Franklins
I'm a certified plug nigga, I always got it in
I supply all the drugs, tell me what you tryna spend
