Aye,

Big booty freak and she foreign, straight up
All My Whole Team We Very Important, Straight Up
Gotta put red on the bottom of your shoes, straight up
Got them racks on me, straight up
With a Gat on me, Straight up
I'm a spazz on you, straight up
Throw some cash on ya, straight up
Molly with the lean feel like you come from another planet, straight up
Every car I drive you know it gotta be Panamera


I fly like plane, and I ain't gone never land
I tie my strings, Cause I run to them bandz
I'm on a molly, don't fuck around with them xan's
Got the baby bottles, full of active and zan's
I'mma hot topic, I'm in popular demand
With a penthouse, but forget where I been staying
In a continental with this bad ass Dominican
Gotta cost over eighty racks for me to go sit in
I'm an astronaut, yes, yes, yes I am
I'm gone take these guap and cash out on a lamb
Buy some red bottems, Jimmy Choo be all you wearing
Fuck the dress code, nigga it ain't no comparing




I'm a go to Mars (then what?)
And take the baddest broad
This ain't no facuade
She a natural porn star
Emilio (what up?)
Vanity, no pooch
Show room floor
We go to sleep in Gucci
This ain't tricking off
This how you kick it with a boss
We blasting off (what?)
Like a rocket what you thought ?
On another level, we put diamonds in our cross
Keep that heavy metal
Like a rock star so don't you cross
From another planet
Yeah, yeah, yes I am
I got your baby mammy and she in love with who I am
Riding panoramic, with the turbo boost
She got red on her like she down with SUWOO
