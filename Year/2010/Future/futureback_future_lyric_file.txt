I really want to give people
A perspective
Of where
You were
What you were doing
Prior to
Even this, I mean
Because you was one them niggers
You know what I'm saying?
Fuck that nigger, you had enough
There's no two man spot
It's only one spot
I'm on some survival shit
Let the whole city riding foreign
Scream!
I got blue stripes
It's thirty years of running
I should be where big meech at
I get so much money
I'm burning off the nest
And then wash my hand
Don't nun touch it
If it ain't them bands
I pray to Messiah
Told him I want it all
Put me in the game
Or pull behind the wall
I'm living lavish
Smashing on these pink toads
More Paper than Kinko's
Drinking bottles and they gold
Drinking lean
And it's active
Yeah popping willies on the benches
We throwing moneys on these hoes
And they ain't even dancing
And it's coming back white
Marilyn Manson
They yelling young future better
And he brung good crack, Machiavelli
And I'm filling up my belly
With pies, Vegeterian
I'm a dog on these hoes, Vetenarian
Yeah, I make movies
Tyler Perry
You're Main Dane
That my secretary
What you could?
Cause I love money
February
Got a lot of shit on my mind
But can't get discouraged
Apply major pressure
You better be worried
You about to get your ish
Are you going to get you ish?
The preacher gone say a scripture
Or asking for forgiveness
I hear the streets calling
All of them ghetto children
It's future out they know
Astronaut, Pluto
Space
Numero uno
I'm coming for your throat
Bitch I got to have it
I know you waiting to taste it
And I'm a murder every trap you can cold case
