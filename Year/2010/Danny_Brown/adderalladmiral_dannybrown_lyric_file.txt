Writing holy mackarel, actual all factual
Out for the capital, matador ya capsules
Hassle the bitch in a castle with the ill grapples
Tackled her asshole, my dick was like a lasso
Fucked her in her mouth she washed it down with Tabasco


You softer than Flanders' son
Don't make me put hands on son
Jump niggas like "Fuck one on one."
Used to be locked up watching One on One
Young Kyla Pratt was looking thick, nigga wanted some
But soon as I got out white bitches by the tons


I fuck bad bitches to Stacy Lattisaw
While you niggas got blue balls like a Avatar
Eating caviar in El Salvador
She running from my dick like it's a bull and she the matador
She a pregnant labrador
Said my metaphors are the highest caliber


I spit hard, you hallmark card poets
So many lines, you can bar code it
She like to lick it on the head while she slow stroke it
Ocean in her panties and I'm 'bout to float through it
Rewind this and just smoke to it
