Kick this one for Brooklyn
Kick this one for the 90's
Now kick this one here for me and my DJ

Now I was rockin' this party in the 90's, Brooklyn
You know where the people get hype
I'll rock a party from Friday to Saturday night
48 hours done, and I still hold the mic

I try to put you down and say that I'm through
But they give it back to me and say, "Continue"
That's the thing about Brooklyn, they never get enough
Of the rap and the music and all the good stuff

That makes your life worth livin' for
Respect is the crowd, the crowd that I draw
Never am I dissed, and never ever shall I be
Ain't a MC alive that can deal with me

And if you think you're the one that can deal with this
Well, you ah best prepare for a big fat dis

Kick this one for Brooklyn
Kick this one for the 90's
Now kick this one here for me and my DJ

Now I was chillin' in Flatbush, mindin' my own
When a girl walked up with a chrome microphone
She said, "Hey, MC Lyte, I heard about you
So here's the microphone, let's see what you can do"

So I took the microphone and I threw it to the ground
'Cause I need no assist when it comes to gettin' down
When I start to rap, she start to shake
She knew to confront me was truly a mistake

So she picked the microphone off the gray concrete
And before I turned around, she was down the street

Kick this one for Brooklyn
Kick this one for the 90's
Now kick this one here for me and my DJ

Now when I'm on the stage, everyone starts starin'
Is it what I'm sayin', or is it what I'm wearin'?
50-50 chance it's what I'm sayin'
And at the same time what my deejay is playin'

If you can get hype and sort of like loud
Yo, K-Rock, kick this one for the crowd
I been to lots of parties, mostly Uptown
And one thing I noticed young people get down

So hip-hoppers, hip-hoppers, from all around
Get with the funky sound

Kick this one for Brooklyn
Now kick this one for the 90's
Now kick this one here for me and my DJ
