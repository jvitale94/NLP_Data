B-Boy, where the fuck you at?
I been looking for you're ass since a quarter past
Hot peas and butter, baby, come and get your supper
Before I make you suffer, that's when you had enough-a

Can I get hot when you hit the jackpot? Surely I can
If you the man, I get loose and produce large amounts of juice
Can you get used to that or do you need
A boost of energy to enter me and get it on?

You're gettin' warm, I can feel you getting closer, now baby
Down this mimosa, you better believe it's time to give a toast
To the woman of the decade, too bad to be played
Get vex and I'm bound to throw shade

All over your body, who's body? Your body, I can rock a party
Like nobody, leavin' time to take home the loot, choosy about
Who I let knock my boots, now let me take sight
While you're lovin' the Lyte, life ain't all that unless you're doing it right

Keep on, keepin' on 'cause you came
And you changed my world, your love so brand new
Keep on, keep kickin' on, doin' it right, right, right

Beware of the stare when I step into peace
I come in peace but I got shit that need to be released
Now who from the chosen shall I choose?
Yeah, now you wish you was in his shoes

I found me a new nigga this year
That knows how to handle this here
Now I look forward to goin' home at night
Brother does mo right under the candlelight

Wax upon my back, can I handle all of that?
I guess I can, can I? Why not if I wanna guess I can
Can I? More honey than a bumble-bee hive
Pulling 69 ways in my archive

Sweet like licorice, sugar for my booga
Juicy like Hi-C or an Icee
I got shit to make your ass write a bad check
'Cause like I said I ain't afraid of the sweat

Beat on my drum if you feel the need to
As I proceed to open up and feed you
I got a longing to put you where you wanna be
Been I can, I get rid of all company

Keep on, keepin' on 'cause you came
And you changed my world, your love so brand new
Keep on, keep kickin' on, doin' it right, right, right

Many have tried strict regulation
Lazy motherfuckers get put on probation
Those that didn't perform well
They gets no answer when they ring-a-ring-a my bell

You're playing with my time, trying to jerk me
Hurt me then dessert me, you better work me
While you got the opportunity
To be in the midst of the L Y T E

Only the strong survive, only the wise excel
Once said by my born-in-hell
Only the lonely die slowly
Left all alone try to control me

Easy does it never ask how was it
Never speak my info why my sheets in the streets
'Cause that ain't cool and that ain't cute
To talk about who knocked the boots on a video shoot

But it's all good, though you gotta get it when you want it
Like your prey, make your move and hop up on it
It's natural, never be ashamed, fuck the fame
Get the name and kick the game
