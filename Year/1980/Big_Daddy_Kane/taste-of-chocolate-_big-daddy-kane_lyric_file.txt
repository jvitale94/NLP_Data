You know B.W. I've heard it said
that a woman is a man's greatest gift

Sure you're right

And success ain't nothin unless you have someone to share it with

Mmmmm, so true, so true
I've always felt that. it's great to achieve in life
Not having someone other than yourself to share it with it is, uhh.

Sho' YOU'RE right

. quite sad

In my case, I may have found someone (mmm)
I want, all, of that someone

Yeah, I know what you mean
Well I'll tell you my friend
Just, communicate with her
And always say what you mean and mean what you say
because, it's her that you want. all of me
Aoww

Come here baby
Come bring ALL of you to me
When I say I want all of you
I mean I want all of you from your head to your feet (mmm)
I wanna taste everything from your lipstick to your toenail polish

C'mere Kane brother

I want you. I want you.
I want to hold you, I want to massage you
I want to comfort you, I want to sooth. you (mm!)
You know the way you're standin still there
I just wanna lay on the floor and make love to your shadow
(A-heh) Sounds silly don't it?

Not really

But for real, let me come on over there
Run my fingers through your hair
Hold your Nair, and undo that brassiere
My dear

Daddy Kane

Because tonight girl, all of me wants, all of you
Ohhhhhhh

Meeeeeeee, all of meeeeeeee
Wants allllllllll of youuuuuuuuuu
Let's start tonight, I know you're right
Over and over and over
Let's do it now, you show me how
Over and over and over again

Oh I can tell you're serious aren't you?
I'm glad to see that you feelin, this way
that there's somebody in this world that.
make you want to give up that kind of commitment
Love is such a beautiful thing when it's, equally shared

Tell em Maestro

When two people, find the same common ground
They call it, having, so much in common
Making love is one of things that people, these days
seem to find too common
