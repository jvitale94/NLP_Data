Dj's Get No Credit
{big daddy kane:}
Hmm yeah, this sound kinda funky, this sound real funky
I'ma get busy on this, man, with ehm, let's see -
Like 8 bars, then i want you to come in with a scratch -
{dj mister cee:}
What? nah man, we ain't havin that!
Just trip, i'm tired of every record we do
I got to be jiggin-jiggin this, jiggin-jiggin that
You know what i'm saying?
Yo, it's time for me to get busy on the mic by myself
On the solo tip, you know what i'm sayin?
So yo, step back and let me show you how a real dj rocks
As i kick it like this:

{dj mister cee:}
A dj gets no damn credit
Don't look at me funny, kane cause, yeah, i said it
I'm always in the background
Supplyin the sound, but my props is yet to be found
Besides, when you're kickin a rap
The only other people you can see is scoob and scrap
So y'all get the girls, okay
But i bet you wasn't gettin skins scratchin for shante
And the first time a record skips
You catch an attitude and always tryin to flip
Now ain't that a bitch
I swear one of these days i'm gonna pull the power switch
Cause i'm always breakin my neck
10 in the mornin you were sleepin on my sound check
And when it's time for the show
I'm supposed to go (big daddy) (hell no)
Am i a man or a machine?
Or just a fat kid who don't supposed to be seen?
Don't you know you wouldn't be so amazin
If i wasn't helpin you out, you black raisin
And you got the nerve and try to complain
Makin a record sayin 'it's hard bein the kane'
Hmm, but all you gotta do is rap
Try carryin some console cases on your back
Well, i'm through with breakin my neck
Until you learn to show your dj some respect
Because without me you'd be butt-naked
So from now on, spin your own damn records
Now put your weight on that shit here
Yeah (yeah) (x5)
I'm outta here
