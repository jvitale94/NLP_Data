Yo, let's talk about AIDS, go on
To the unconcerned and uninformed
You think you can't get it? Well, you're wrong
Don't dismiss or blacklist the topic that ain't gonna stop it

Now if you go about it right, you just might save your life
Don't be uptight, come join the fight
We're gonna tell you how you can get it and how you won't
All of the do's and all of the don't's

I got some news for you so listen, please
It's not a black, white or gay disease
Are you ready, pep? Yeah, I'm set
All right then, come on, bet

Let's talk about sex, baby
Let's talk about you and me
Let's talk about all the good things
And the bad things that may be

Let's talk about sex
Let's talk about sex
Let's talk about sex

So if you do come up HIV positive, mmm, or have AIDS
Yeah, we just want you to know, What? That there are treatments
That's right, and the earlier, the sooner, detected the better off
You'll be, tell 'em please

Hey, yo, pep, you get checked?
Yep, every year, G

Now, you don't get AIDS from kisses, touches, mosquito bites
Or huggin', toilet seats, telephones, stop buggin'
You get it from sex or a dirty drug needle, anal or oral now
People, women can give it to men and men mostly to women

The facts are simple, right and exact
And once you get it, there's no turnin' back for you
There ain't a cure, so you gotta be sure
Protect yourself or don't have sex anymore

Mothers might give it to their babies through the womb
Or through birth, don't be an ass and assume
AIDS ain't got no smell or taste
It don't care about your race

You see a nice, kind face, you think you're safe?
I'm sorry, that's just not the case
There's no debate, converse with your mate
And don't wait until it's too late

Let's talk about sex, baby
Let's talk about you and me
Let's talk about all the good things
And the bad things that may be

Let's talk about sex
Let's talk about sex
Let's talk about sex
Let's talk about sex

Ladies, all the ladies, louder now, help me out
Come on, all the ladies, let's practice safe sex, all right

Yo, salt, What? You know what else will stop the spread of AIDS?
Uhh, huh, if everybody stop cheating and messing around
And just stay with one person and wear condoms
