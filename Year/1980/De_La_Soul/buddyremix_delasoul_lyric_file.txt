Meany, meany, meany, meany, meany (Say what?)
Meany, meany, meany, meany, meany, meany
(Oh, you gotta do that again, Dove)
Meany, meany, meany, meany, meany (Say what?)
Meany, meany, meany, meany, meany (Say what?)
Meany, meany, meany, meany, meany, mean (OK)

Hello, it's the Soul
Troopin in with the Jungle patrol
And this ones about the KO's, the knockouts out there
Who I call my buddy
Hold up (Wait a minute)



Now just wait, we're gonna talk about Buddy on this plate
But before we let the herd out the gate
Make sure the levels are straight out the jungle
(The Jungle, the Jungle, the Brothers, the Brothers)



De La Soul, from the soul
Black medallions, no gold
Hangin out with Pos, hangin out with Mase
Buddy, buddy, buddy all in my face



For the lap, Jimbrowski must wear a cap
Just in case the young girl likes to clap
Ain't for the wind but before I begin
I initiate the buddy with a slap



Now drop the beat, for the Phifer from A Tribe Called Quest
When I see Buddy, I will never half step
I'll just do her Tribal style and then jet
The Buddy that I like is to be sexy and nice
Just good enough for the one they call Phife
A brown skin Buddy with shoulder length hair
Nice firm breasts and a round dairy-aire



Now for the next, I'm the Q-Tip from A Tribe Called Quest
And when I quest for the Buddy, I don't fess
For my jimmy wants nothing but the best (the best)
The best (Ooh Wee!)
Let's stick out the jimmy and see what we can catch
(Stick 'em up, stick 'em up jimmy)
Next won't be needed unless (Jenny wanna get right to the flesh)



Dancin on the dance floor
Girl, it's you that I adore
Step off stage, they scream for more
Native Tongues got rhymes galore



Snap my fingers, make you mine
If not, I'll snap a second time
After that, I guarantee
You will be standing next to me



Fly buddy (buddy) don't you know you make me go nutty (nutty)
I'm so glad that you're not a fuddy duddy (duddy)
Not too skinny and not too chubby (chubby)
Soft like silly putty
Miss Crabtree (Crabtree) I hope that you're not mad at me
Cuz I told you that it was your buddy (buddy)
That was making me ever so horny (horny)
Junglelistically horny



I won't lie, I love B-U-D-D-Y
Cuz I never let it walk on by
When it comes to me and Jenny, I seem (very serious)
Like a big friend
Buddy is an act that occurs on the lip
When Jenny and Jimmy start shootin the gift
Boy let me get shot, I won't even riff



On the dial, my Buddy talks to me for a while
Plug Two is the (Q-Tip: Q to her Tip)
On the A-side or sometimes the flip (word up)
Buddy, is the bud to my daisy tree 
And the luuden to my do-re-mi
And the pleaser to my man Plug Three
(Plug Three gets the whole caboodle)



Behind my bush, my Buddy likes the way that I push
And like a champ, just knock it on out
Never ever once sellin out (Well let loose the juice)
My Buddy helps me to (De La my Soul)
Keepin Jimmy in total control
Without Buddy, I'd be on a roll



Now as the lady
I thought that Jungle and Quest and Soul would just maybe
Give me the chance to say that I get crazy
Due to the fact I let Buddy amaze me
As a matter of fact, it pleases me in many ways
I decided that it was time for Monie Love to say
That when it comes to the three, you know that I don't play
Cuz to me chasin Buddy is the perfect way (perfect way)
To spend the day (to spend the day)



Oooh child, things are gettin a little easier
Oooh Buddy gets easier (yeah)
Oooh child, things are gettin a little easier
Oooh Buddy gets easier



Girl, I heard you're lookin for some good times
If you Quest from the Soul, here's what we'll find
Whole lotta fun, lots of fun together
Just like kissin cousins(Yeah, that's kinda clever)
Close like bosoms, bosoms stay close
If you be my Buddy, I won't toast
That we're like Ethel Mertz and Lucille MacGillicuddy
You can be mine and I can be your Buddy



The best Buddy's in evening wear
Long lovin less Tru know (he's in there)
I feel sorry for those who pay a fare (a fee?)
Word to the D
I don't beg, I just tease my Buddy with my right leg (ha-ha)
And when it's ready what's said is Buddy is best in bed (Word to the D)



Buddy buddy told us all to get into a circle
Said don't bug because I won't hurt you
All I really wanna do is freak you (You know what? She freaked us)



And I watched and then I checked my Swatch to see the time
The Soul had formed a Buddy line
And that Buddy was mine, all mine



Now when Quest, Jungle and De La Soul 
Is at the club, our ritual unfolds
Grab our bones and start swingin our hands
(Then Jenny start flockin in everywhere)
Cuz Jennifer just wants to stay aware
Yo fellas, should we keep her aware
(Mmm, Hmm...yeah!!!)
