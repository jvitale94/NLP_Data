Potholes in my Lawn? You're those weird guys, De La Soul, right? 
 Yeah, what's up little man, how you feeling, I'm Dove, how you
feeling. 
 Yo what's up man, my name is Pos. 
 What's up, I'm Mase. Yo, shorty, what's your name? 
 Oh, my name? Jeff. You guys are walking? Now rappers ain't
supposed to walk. 
 Sorry little man, but you know... 
 Jeff. I told you, my name is Jeff. If you guys are rappers, 
where's your dukey gold chains? Y'all don't have no dukey gold chains. 
 We don't wear gold chains, we'd rather spend our money on 
more important things like, women, necessities... 
 And video games! 
 Y'all are crazy. No chains, dag. Okay, where's your BMW? 
You're not supposed to walk. Where's your jeeps, your Maximas? 
 Maximas? Yo, Maxin' would break my flow. And with the cause of 
gas, Jeff man, I'd rather take the transit that's mass. 
 What you say? You are C-R-A-Z-E-E. Crazee. Don't you know you 
can't be def if you don't have no gold? Or a car, man? What's up? 
 Who told you that? 
 Everybody who's def has gold, cars, money, girls, clothes... 
 Wait a minute, wait a minute, shorty, you're buggin'. Do you like
Plug Tunin' and
Potholes? 
 Yeah that song's def. 
 But we don't wear no gold chains, nor do we ride BMW's and 
Maxes or Jeeps, yet you still think our music is def, right? Wait a
minute. Did I say 'def'? 
 Rrrr-RRAH! 
 What? 
 Nothing, nothing. It's just that we don't deal with all that 
materialistic stuff, but we still got what it takes to please and 
supply our listeners, understand my man? 
 Where's your beepers? Why don't you have beepers? Everybody 
wears beepers. You have to have beepers to look down. 
 AAAUUGHHH! Little man is brainwashed indeed! 
 Nah, nah. Beepers are the least of status situators, man. Plus 
I find them ugly as parking tickets. 
 You guys talk funny. 
 Well actually our verbal is kinetic, so when released flow A to 
Z is perfectly pitched in andvance in intricacy. 
 Yeah you homeboys are really bugged. 
 Wait a minute. Did he say... 
 Bugged? 
 Rrrr-RRAH! 
 So no car, no beepers, no gold. That's weak man, that's weak. 
 Jesus, did he say 'weak?' Jesus, they never learn. 
 Foolish mind, have I, have I. 
 Actin' like that lady! 
 That lady! 
 Peace, my brother...
