Booty rappers posin' as gun clappers get bitch smacked
Need to switch to bein' actors, image is all ya after
Ho galacta in the lip, the clappers and the clips
Will flip a flow like divine be turnin' tricks

I'ma take mine wactha like when the beat come soft
I leave darkness where there used to be your front teeth
I'm heartless, when it comes to havin' the back of my partners
Yeah, we artists but testin' us ain't the smartest

You can huff, puff, but blow me down I doubt it kid
Or get yo' ass whooped behind what ya mouth did
You need more 'Hail Mary's' than a catholic
Yo ass ain't slick I'll mess your shit quick

I got connects, I get stuck like glue stand to the F you
I had to make it so your parents forget you
'Cause if I let you get over and then I pass you
Think you can do it on a reg so I'ma wreck you

Elements that I'm among, these none
Fools be gettin' done, but over dumb reasons
Y'all didn't know
Elements that I'm among, these none
Betta check it out before you become one

Elements that I'm among, these none
Fools be gettin' done, but over dumb reasons
Y'all didn't know
Elements that I'm among, these none
Betta check it out before you become one

Now you said no tricks in '86 it's time to build
Now we gone be pushin' '96 and niggas still gotta kill
Tryin' to keep it real but is it really real?
If you could fly is it?

Get between my legs
You fuckin' kid, you'd be the man but hold ya head
Because if a fifth was a fifth we all be drunk
Nigga don't, put no yayo in my blunt

I just, wanna bring the funk like a puma
Yo wannabe niggas is fired or be the ill reputed
You throw shade, I throw it too, more than you can chew
I get back at you, lyrically hack at you

I keep the facts here, I keep it real hell yeah
I keep the facts there, don't make me hate you like a papsmear
That's where, I get ticked, matter fact in the '96
I'm also pistol grip pump on my lap at all times shit

Niggas be on some black on black crime shit
And I can't let it slide
'Cause I'm terrified that I might be the next homicide
The pound is on my side

Elements that I'm among, these none
Fools be gettin' done, but over dumb reasons
Y'all didn't know
Elements that I'm among, these none
Betta check it out before you become one

Elements that I'm among, these none
Fools be gettin' done, but over dumb reasons
Y'all didn't know
Elements that I'm among, these none
Betta check it out before you become one

Niggas be all in my face like government be in my check
Every time I pick up the mic and begin to wreck
But right now my job is more important than a nigga
I'm in to peace, it's so tricky this ain't the way I figured

An evident I wasn't raised that way
We kicks a grip to stay that way
And I'm tryin' to stay forever free like AZ
Baskin' in the riches of this hip hop M U S I C

'Cause when the east is in the house
Oh my God" is right
I know girls that's givin' niggas fair fights
So you damn right

I'ma stick up for mine, like a queen at a bee
And I'ma get my own rhythm without a G
Hey, if ya kiddie come come, well ya need to run run
Like a bee y'all get stomped, by my diggy dumps dumps
All because of ya tounge
And I'll be lampin' in the sun when the day is done

Elements that I'm among, these none
Fools be gettin' done, but over dumb reasons
Y'all didn't know
Elements that I'm among, these none
Betta check it out before you become one

Elements that I'm among, these none
Fools be gettin' done, but over dumb reasons
Y'all didn't know
Elements that I'm among, these none
Betta check it out before you become one
