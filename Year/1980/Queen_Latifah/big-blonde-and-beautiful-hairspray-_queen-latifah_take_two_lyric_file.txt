Bring on that pecan pie
Pour some sugar on it
Sugar don't be shy
Scoop me up a mess of that chocolate swirl
Don't be stingy
I'm a growing girl
I offer, big love with no apology
How can I deny the world the most of me
I am not afraid to throw my weight around
pound by, pound by pound
Because I'm big blonde and beautiful
Face the fact
It's simply irrefutable
No one wants a meal
That only offers a least
Girl we're serving up the whole damn feast
Slice me off a piece of that hog head cheese
Take a look inside my book of recipes
Now don't you sniff around for something fluffy and light
We need a man who brings a man sized appetite
Could use a pinch of sugar
And a dash of spice
I'll let you lick the spoon
Because it tastes so nice
We'll keep it in the oven 'til it's.
good and hot
Keep on stirring 'til it hits the spot
Because I'm big blonde and beautiful
There is nothing 'bout us that's unsuitable
why sit in the bleachers
timid and afraid
when Edna, you look like the whole parade!
They say that white has might
And thin is in
Well, that's just bull
'Cause ladies big is back
And as for black
It's beautiful!
All shapes and sizes
Follow me!
Who wants a twig
When you can climb a whole tree?
yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah
owwww!
groovy baby groovy!
