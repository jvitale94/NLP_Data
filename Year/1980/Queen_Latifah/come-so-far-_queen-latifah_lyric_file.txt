QUEEN LATIFAH
Hey old friend, let?s look back
On the crazy clothes we wore
Ain?t it fun to look back
And to see it?s all been done before

ZAC EFRON
All those nights together
Are a special memory

NIKKI BLONSKY
And I can?t wait for tomorrow
Just as long as you?re
dancing next to me

EVERYONE
?Cause it?s so clear
Every year
We get stronger

ZAC EFRON
What?s gone is gone

ELIJAH KELLEY
The past is the past

NIKKI BLONSKY
Turn the radio up

QUEEN LATIFAH
And then hit the gas
?Cause . . .

EVERYONE
I know we?ve Come So Far
But we?ve Got So Far To Go
I know the road seems long
But it won?t be long ?till it?s time to go
So, most days we?ll take it fast
And some nights lets we'll it slow
I know we?ve Come So Far
But baby, baby
We?ve Got So Far To Go

ZAC EFRON
Hey old friend, together
Side by side and year by year

NIKKI BLONSKY
The road was filled with twists
and turns
Oh but that?s the road that
got us here

QUEEN LATIFAH
Let?s move past the bad times
But before those memories fade

ELIJAH KELLEY
Let?s forgive but not forget
And learn from all the mistakes we made

EVERYONE
?Cause it?s so clear
Every year
We get stronger
So don?t give up
And don?t say when
And just get back on the road again
?Cause . . .
I know we?ve Come So Far
But we?ve Got So Far To Go
I know the road seems long
But it won?t be long till it?s
time to go
So, most days we?ll take it fast
And some nights we'll take it slow
I know we?ve Come So Far
Oh but baby, baby
We?ve Got So Far To Go
Hey old friend come along for the ride
There?s plenty of room so jump inside
The highway?s rocky every now and then
But it so much better than
where I?ve been
Just keep movin?, at your own speed
Your heart is all the compass
you?ll ever need
Let?s keep cruisin? the road we?re on
?Cause the rear view mirror only shows
what?s gone, gone, gone
Got so far to go
?Cause it?s so clear

ELIJAH KELLEY
Every year
We get stronger

EVERYONE
So shine that light
Take my hand
And let?s dance into tomorrow land
?Cause . . .
I know we?ve Come So Far
But we?ve Got So Far To Go
I know the road seems long
But it won?t be long till it?s
time to go
So, most days we?ll take it fast
And some nights we'll take it slow
I know we?ve Come So Far
Oh but baby, baby
We?ve Got So Far To Go
