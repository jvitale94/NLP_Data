Never Forget - Maher Zain

Every night and every day
Never forget to say la ilaha illa Allah
Never forget to say la ilaha illa Allah

When you're walking down the street
And you see the clouds in the sky
Praise him and always repeat
The name of the Most High
And say with every heartbeat la ilaha illa Allah

Every night and every day
Every night and every day
Never forget to say la ilaha illa Allah
Never forget to say la ilaha illa Allah

No matter where you are or what you do
Remember Allah watches over you
He's the light of the heavens and earth
He's the first and He is the last
Obey Him and always say la ilaha illa Allah

Every night and every day
Every night and every day
Never forget to say la ilaha illa Allah
Never forget to say la ilaha illa Allah

La ilaha illa Allah
Never forget to say la ilaha illa Allah

Every night and every day
Every night and every day
Never forget to say la ilaha illa Allah
Never forget to say la ilaha illa Allah

La ilaha illa Allah
