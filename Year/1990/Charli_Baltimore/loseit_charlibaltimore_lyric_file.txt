

Uh huh, yeah, yeah
Uh huh, yeah, Storch
Uh, uh huh, yeah

Boo yah, you hit the lotto
'Cause Chuck had a bottle
And I'm feelin' tight woozy
Feelin' like Jacuzzi
Soak and you smokin'
Cali Kush and chokin'
My pink nipples pokin'
You ready to stroke it?
Jokin', ain't sweet to bag it
Resume got to be spotless
For you to tag it
I'm a handful like fat ass
When you grab it
Take a stab
Cold turkey in my attic (tell me)
Ever had a bitch like me?
You ain't never had a chick like C
All struck, tossed up
'Bout the way I flow
But so low, that's the way I roll
So let's go, but uh
Hold up, wait a minute who he?
Gangsta, gangsta, sure enough, oooh eeeh
Come ride if you come my way
'Cause all night is the way I play (ok)

Now what you sayin' again?
Tell me what it's hittin' for
You only got 4 minutes like
I'm 'bout to spit it
Doin' 5, I hit the door (woah)

Don't talk just do it
Don't beat around the bush get to it
Hope you got your wing up
Better drink a Redbull
In a minute I'm a make you lose it
You lose it, you lose it
CB goin' make you lose it
I got my low cut jeans
You can see my G-String
Guaranteed I'm a make you lose it

Listen, I ain't startin' nothin'
I ain't finishin'
Pressed to get me in horizontal position
And comin' at me sideways
I ain't listenin'
You let the fuck up
Boy I'm nitro glycerine
Firestarter, if you right I go harder
My guard up, your jaw up
Runnin' your black carter
Shake 'em up, explode
Like chic soda, it's
Coca-cola keep blowin' my Motorola
Told ya I need a soldier
Think you in love with a stripper
Like T-Pain where that pole up
And I ain't talkin' metal I'm talkin'
Hold the fuckin' sunshine
Tell wifey you 'bout to roll what
And it ain't Kush wet hash or haze
It's them lips legs and ass
That fuckin' amaze
Come ride if you're comin' my way
And all night still the way I play then (ok)

Now what you sayin' again?
Tell me what it's hittin' for
You only got 4 minutes like
I'm 'bout to spit it
Doin' 5, I hit the door (woah)

Don't talk just do it
Don't beat around the bush get to it
Hope you got your wing up
Better drink a Redbull
In a minute I'm a make you lose it
You lose it, you lose it
CB goin' make you lose it
I got my low cut jeans
You can see my G-String
Guaranteed I'm a make you lose it

Charli got the good and plenty (plenty)
I'm a perform for you (for you)
I hope you didn't bite off
More than you can chew (chew)
Go ahead and take a shot of Henne (Henne)
'Cause I'm about to work you out (ow)
No need for conversation ('sation)
Just show me what you're all about (ow!)

The metal to the pedal, skip the chit-chat
Mix Sprite with dip-n-dab and told 'em sit back
10 minutes later you feelin' that kick back
Get kicked in my flick, I hand picked 'em
Stressed to lick their, seat belt clicked and
He clicked off, I got hit off and I ain't victim
Bounce game sickening, that's the way I play
But all night after hustling, you need to stay (ok)

Now what you sayin' again?
Tell me what it's hittin' for
You only got 4 minutes like
I'm 'bout to spit it
Doin' 5, I hit the door (woah)

Don't talk just do it
Don't beat around the bush get to it
Hope you got your wing up
Better drink a Redbull
In a minute I'm a make you lose it
You lose it, you lose it
CB goin' make you lose it
I got my low cut jeans
You can see my G-String
Guaranteed I'm a make you lose it
