Still remember all the good times spent
Trips to the beach and watchin' horror flicks
Even though your mind wasn't with each other
You showed each other love like sister and brother
When i was small everyday you picked me up from school
Loved you so much cause you were soulful
Told me everything i know from youth till i grown
So why you waiting to tell me how the problems grown
You died on your birthday
It was my worst day
Call you dad know but i did it from my first day
Just like my dog 18 with mad cream
Popped out on the drug scene
Had cats from other teams
Hatin
Went from juvy hall to willy(?)
In 6 months time Makaveli and Philli
But it's hell on everybodys tell
Gun shots to your back on valentines day
I miss you bell(?)


Didn't we almost have it all
But love was all we had worth giving
The rise with you was worth the fall of yah
Cause loving you made life worth living


17 when i meet you
Never bet you would help me bring a life to the world
And bless in you
I thought we were destined to have our names tattoed
But i guess your depression got the best of you
With test in you things are gonna work out
But you got scared and had to murk out
Suicied ain't the only way
It's the lonely way
Now everybody just left me with death to except
But i still had you
I still had my boo
We were right there at the height of everything
The height of your carrer i still wear my ring
You said you wouldn't leave me like everyone else
One bullet took you instead
Infared
Now i can't even pick up the phone to call you
Damn we had it all too


Didn't we almost have it all
The nights we had until the moring
You know you'll never love like that again
Didn't we almost have it all


Everbody didn't know what to do about the lost
Just let it past
But i'll never forget
Death is the final set
But i survive
And try my best to keep the memories alive
Yo everbody
Say we be


Though were apart
It just seems so far
But i know in my heart
I will always love you
