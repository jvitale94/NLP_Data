Chuch

If you see me when I come around
(That's chuch)
Breakin' all these hoes down
(That's chuch)

Got the Cadillacs and Bentleys
(That's chuch)
Got money to the ceiling, y'all
(That's chuch)

Everywhere I go they scream
(That's chuch)
Everybody, say it, now
(That's chuch)

I come through stompin' in my big black boots
I keep 'em jumpin', jumpin', stayin' funky, funky for you
Whether Prada, Gucci, Versace
My coochie draped in Le Perla, watches like Liberace
From my head to my stockings
I promise to rock this and keep it poppin'

Ain't no stoppin' me, naw 'cuz I'm on fire like a cigarette
Get higher when the beat quick we stick
Shittin' on niggas to heeze on 'em just to eat quick
Recently, I've been eliminating heathens and hypocrites
When they see me on the streets in a screaming whip
It's hard to not hate so don't even trip 'cuz I'm chuch

If you see me when I come around
(That's chuch)
Breakin' all these hoes down
(That's chuch)

Got the Cadillacs and Bentleys
(That's chuch)
Got money to the ceiling, y'all
(That's chuch)

Everywhere I go they scream
(That's chuch)
Everybody, say it, now
(That's chuch)

I'm chuch, I'm smokin', I'm sharp, I'm hot
I'm sexy, I'm bangin', I'm sickening, I rock
I'm the hottest, a hard act to follow
Never bite off more than I can chew up, I might swallow
If you got a problem, holla at me tomorrow
'Cuz I'm too busy bein' the leader you follow

Nigga, I'm cold blooded in a mustard colored Ferrari
Somebody sure love me
I hit that nigga banker, count up that ugly shit I ain't buyin'
That's chuch, whatever work for you
I'm so tough that I just lay all my coo
I'm too much that I only give a little to you
And show you how these niggas up in Chi-town do

If you see me when I come around
(That's chuch)
Breakin' all these hoes down
(That's chuch)

Got the Cadillacs and Bentleys
(That's chuch)
Got money to the ceiling, y'all
(That's chuch)

Everywhere I go they scream
(That's chuch)
Everybody, say it now
(That's chuch)

Like Caddies and furs
(Chuch)
House in the suburbs
(Chuch)
Big ass rings and chains
(Chuch)
Big trucks sittin' on thangs
(Chuch)

Diamonds and jewels
(Chuch)
Shining down on you fools is
  (Chuch)
Rhyming the way I do that's
(Chuch)
Blindin' 'em when I come through
(Chuch)

Bling, bling that's right, everything Da Brat-tat-tat do
You could identify that as chuch, not church
That don't mean to da flo, that's chuch
When you got the muthafucking hat to match
Nigga, that's chuch

If you see me when I come around
(That's chuch)
Breakin' all these hoes down
(That's chuch)

Got the Cadillacs and Bentleys
(That's chuch)
Got money to the ceiling, y'all
(That's chuch)

Everywhere I go they scream
(That's chuch)
Everybody, say it now

If you see me when I come around
(That's chuch)
Breakin' all these hoes down
(That's chuch)

Got the Cadillacs and Bentleys
(That's chuch)
Got money to the ceiling, y'all
(That's chuch)

Everywhere I go they scream
(That's chuch)
Everybody, say it now
(That's chuch)
