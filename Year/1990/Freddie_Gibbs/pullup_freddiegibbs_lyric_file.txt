People pull me over, I'm a be a goner
Every time we hook up, smell like California
She said baby make it happen, I'm 'bout to pull up on ya

I pull up I pull up I pull up I pull up I pull up I pull up
I said I pull up on you
I pull up I pull up I pull up I pull up I pull up I pull up
I said I pull up on you

You then talk my talk, you know Cali code
Two top three, you're still alone
That 40 cal in that desert isle
(I pull up I pull up I pull up I pull up I pull up I pull up
I said I pull up on you)
Sturdy engine, 6 straight
My weed strong, my money long
Them bad bitches, my safe up
I tell 'em what I've been drinkin' on
Keep fuckin' ride, with me you're on
(I pull up I pull up I pull up I pull up I pull up I pull up
I said I pull up on you)


I said I pull up like monkey boss, OG and sweet cigars
Might just bust they brain when I pull that whip thing out my garage
Bought that shit for the boss, souped up and super charged
You lame bitch a super freak, man you say that on my good cars
My bank's stinkin' everywhere I go
Danc eon it, in your head I know
Nike boxers, my piggy bank
I make a bitch faint with all the bread I blow
Bend it over, girl head to toe
Pulled it out and she trained to go
Bitch trippin', get 8 to 60
She'll stop predictin' my 84
My eyes red and my mass black
And that loud pack, the bitch passed that
If you dumb niggas get jacked at
Then you ain't got the nuts to come blast that
Look, I'm 2 thousand they two though
Need dough low, straight juiced up
You rap niggas might talk tough but they pulled off and we pulled up


You know I've been drinkin', smell like marijuana
People pull me over, I'm a be a goner
Every time we hook up, smell like California
She said baby make it happen, I'm 'bout to pull up on ya

You then talk my talk, you know Cali code
Two top three, you're still alone
That 40 cal in that desert isle
(I pull up I pull up I pull up I pull up I pull up I pull up
I said I pull up on you)
Sturdy engine, 6 straight
My weed strong, my money long
Them bad bitches, my safe up
I tell 'em what I've been drinkin' on
Keep fuckin' ride, with me you're on
(I pull up I pull up I pull up I pull up I pull up I pull up
I said I pull up on you)


I got 20 2's in that coop, roof back on that Rarri
Them hoe too when I come through, if they with you then I'm sorry
We pullin' up, hopin' out
We pull 'em in just point 'em out
We goin' hard, they goin' in
We showin' up and they showin' out
We throwin' out they loose change
Got bank flows and roof lane
I got big thousands and cedar mouse
I'm still slangin' that cocaine
On fire like propane
Kick it hard like pro games
Where the bitch? Who get a bitch?
Go ask a bitch what's your name
My nigga jizzin' on them little freaky hoes
I got the ones who with it but it's a secret though
In the presidential sweet all broads
Trade 'em like baseball cards
Probly all broads we ball hard
They pullin' up and they throwin' down
They drinkin' out, they drunk the fuck
I got blunts to pop, the cush goin around


You know I've been drinkin', smell like marijuana
People pull me over, I'm a be a goner
Every time we hook up, smell like California
She said baby make it happen, I'm 'bout to pull up on ya

You then talk my talk, you know Cali code
Two top three, you're still alone

Keep fuckin' ride, with me you're on
(I pull up I pull up I pull up I pull up I pull up I pull up

Keep fuckin' ride, with me you're on
