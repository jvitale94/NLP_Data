Take all they money and jewelry for good-dicking these hoes
Buck-naked, leave 'em exposed, my bitches, I line 'em up
Sex texts, naked pics, have 'em thinking she down to fuck
That's my MO, at the M-O-T-E-L
With a hot plate of some hard bitch, I bet these sells
Quicker than Jordans on a Saturday, psycho like Donny Hathaway
God as my witness
Going for bitches like I'm a Latter Day
Saint, but I ain't, I'm one of Satan's descendents
Fathering nigger's flows, I should claim 'em like they dependents
Taxin' niggers on wax cause they get it
Rap is the act, trappin' and packing gats
Arrest court date, hard times, heart break
Grind 'til the last crumb, selling dubs soft shake
An open shop and a close mouth'll keep your mouth fed


Lord giveth, Lord taketh away
Make a dollar for tomorrow, we gon' take it today
I guess I'm in to take your shit, that's what it take to get paid
You a gangster, do your thing and take your shit to the grave, nigger


Uh, we book niggers for clubs
They say they don't need security, claiming they really thugs
I'm legit, so I could give two shits if you really was
Put some plug with some fools that'll put your dick in the mud
Have a rapper do a walk through, let the nigger walk out
Pistols on the promoter, throw chippers so we gonna chalk out
Niggers take off that shiny shit
Man these niggas dry, cutting they dope with vitamins
Acetone, hard to leave that crack alone
Government got heroin narcotics strung out on this methodone
New dope, new wave, four P's, oxycotin, no beef
Can't break it down or shoot it, think you gotta snort these
Plenty niggas OD, not just on drugs
But I'm chasing money fuck it, so the fo' wait for fo G's
And it was some bullshit, but I had to get it in
Took it back from his ass and re-up and sell that shit again
