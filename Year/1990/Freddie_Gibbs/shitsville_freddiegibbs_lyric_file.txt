

Yeah (where's my money bitch?)
Uhh

Niggaz ain't gon' shit then get the fuck up off the toilet stool
Bent behind my tint as I commence to take these boys to school
Don't drive no yellow bus but I got mayonnaise and mustard
Bold tires, gold wires on my Chevrolet bucket
And now my transmission leakin and my rear-suspension squeakin
Drop a rock off to my geeker, fix my shit man I'm out here creepin
Twist that shit but I'm out here tweakin for that 20 twin twin
Kick that shit in '95 or watching (Friday) with my friends
Fucked your bitch in ninety-six hit that pussy for 6 minutes
Said the dick was everything she envisioned on each visit
Poppa kept his condoms in his bottom drawer they for his bottom ho
I stole that shit when I was out, I wonder if my momma know
I wonder if she found the dimes and nickels in my Nike box
I wonder if she know her older brother like to light them rocks
I wonder if she able to get by if I get killed
Tell her I was just knee deep in the shit, welcome to Shitsville nigga


You wake up every day and pray before you sleep, right?
You motherfuckers just like me
You shed tears when you hurtin if I cut you then you bleed, right?
You motherfuckers just like me
But bitch you actin like your shit don't stank - the shit's real
Bitch you actin like your shit don't stank - the shit's real
I said you actin like the shit don't stank - the shit's real
Bitch you actin like the shit don't stank - welcome to Shitsville

Yo, uhh; niggaz ain't gon' shit then get the fuck up off the pizzot
Got bowls of live in my living room like I was Lennox
Trapped a nigga and his wife up for his wallet and his wristwatch
And they say I might do life in jail for kidnap, bitch I did not
give a single solitary fuck; I stand on all ten toes
one dick and two nuts - don't do yayo or shoot up
But I went back and forth with some work done went threw a few plugs
This white devil society dare a nigga to do drugs
and dare yo ass to deal 'em, distribute and conceal 'em
My niggaz don't got no boats or no ports, how you think we get 'em?
Crack was black America's cup of coffee in the beginnin
When they crept up on you wiggers, you crackers couldn't fight the feelin
Motherfuck euthanasia I'll lace your food up with razors
Make you gargle with salt water, excuse yourself from my table
I fathered these fuck niggaz with fables; pussy I been real
Good on any street, up Shit's Creek, it's Shitsville nigga



Cheat on your girl, your wife sneak out and fuck hoes
You motherfuckers just like me
Drink all the liquor, blow weed, probably play wit'cha nose
You motherfuckers just like me
I said you motherfuckers just like me
I said you motherfuckers just like me
I know you motherfuckers just like me
You ain't no better, ho you just like me
Uhh...
