No sympathy.....

News fit for rhyme
BS fit to spit
The hate that hate produced
Swung up in a noose
Most them history pages
Comin’ off stages
Colors genders and ages
Devil
Black brown yellow red but
White
Supremacy
Tendency in currency
Estrogen
Robbin my oxygen
Still dissin skin
Inform my next of kin

(Now get in the back of the car
For What?
Let’s go!)

Crazy
Govt created grown up
80s crack babies
Treat your ass cold
Till the frostbite bites
In December
The devil remembers


Man don’t you worry ‘bout (God) No! Get down
Man don’t you worry ‘bout (Evil) No! Get down
Man don’t you worry ‘bout (God) No! Get down
Man don’t you worry ‘bout (Evil) No! Get down


Pitch black
It was you who got in the devil’s bed
Didn't you see this coming?
The great satan, a global terrorist
Didn’t you see the smoke?
Maybe it’s time for us to pick up the gun
No sympathy from the devil

Ain't lettin it slide
Flippin
Love
And genocide
Ain't forgiven that spit
That came wit a
Culture kit
Since when did you decide
The truth should hide
You 20-30-40 I’m 55
Double nickel
Sick this cell
Like sickle
I ain’t your typical
Watch what you heard
Ain’t revenge of the nerds
I’m in my September
But the devil remembers


Man don’t you worry ‘bout (God) No! Get down
Man don’t you worry ‘bout (Evil) No! Get down
Man don’t you worry ‘bout (God) No! Get down
Man don’t you worry ‘bout (Evil) No! Get down

There’s been nights
Where them knights cursed us
Who fills the jail cells right up and first us
I don’t believe a damn word I receive
Gotta lotta nerve saying
If you dont like it just leave
Like who gives a damn
If they kill another man
Woman or child
Behind another smile
Now see young folk
Pass the baton
In the same ol’ thing
Carry on
Carry on

No sympathy
