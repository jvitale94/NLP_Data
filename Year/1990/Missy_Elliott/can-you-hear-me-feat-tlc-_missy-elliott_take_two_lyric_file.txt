This is the information for
For where you can send the flowers
Its for Aaliyah
Ill give you the phone number in case you need it
Ok we'll see you
Take care of yourself
I love you
Bye bye

I been checkin on your moms and dad
And your brother since the day you left
Passed on and went away with God
But for your mom its been
So damn hard
I hate to even hear her cry
Aaliyah she asked me why
Would a baby girl go this way

Can you give me better words to say

One day she'll see you again
With the same old beautiful smile
Long hair and the voice of a hummingbird
You'll be singing them same old songs
Aalyiah can you hear me
I hope that you're proud of me
Me and Tim we been doing our thing
But Its never been the same
Since you had to go

I aint never met a friend
More incredible

I know you in real good hands
With God but damn I miss you
Aayliah if you see Left Eye will you tell her
That me and Boz miss her too
Cuz no ones gunna fill her space

TC L not replace
Yall the reasons we learned to love
Fly high with your 22 doves

One day we'll see her again
With the same old beautiful smile
Crazy but sexy cool
She'll be rapping them same old songs
Lisa can you hear me
We hope that you're proud of us

TLC has come along way
But its never been the same
Since you had to go
Cuz the healing process will be long and slow

Aaliyah I know you in a safer place
You face to face with the creator
And our maker
And if you and Left-Eye happen to chat tell her

Me and Teone we know that she much safer
If you see Biggie Smalls up in the clouds tell him
Hes still the illest MC we had around
2pac there is only one
Big Pun RIP we say one

One day we'll see yall again
With the same old beautiful smiles
All styles so many styles
And yall be doing the same old things
The last time we seen ya
We hope yall can change the world
Let them see how short life be
It would never be the same since you had to go
To the music world yall are incredible
