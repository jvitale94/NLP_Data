Are we on the air?

This is
A Missy Elliott
Exclusive

And I came to bring the pain, hardcore to the brain
Ooh baby, what's your name?
I love the way you're spittin' the game
You made me change from thinkin' all guys the same
You the type of guy I wanna marry in months
Got exactly what I want
And ain't no fakin' the funk
Your attitude is funk and you're makin' me crunk
(C'mon)

Yes, it's real baby
Got me so crazy
Light my fire dirty
Like the way you serve me
Stimulate my body
Crunk just like a party
Oh, you won't be sorry
My poppy, I'm your mommy

I'm in your life to come and let you explore
Take you on a tour
The kind of guys that be talkin' that noise
Is the reason I ignore
And you the one I wanna take to meet Moms
"He's a rap superstar"
I wanna be the one you like
I'm sure to do you right

Yes, it's real baby
Got me so crazy
Light my fire dirty
Like the way you serve me
Stimulate my body
Crunk just like a party
Ooh, you won't be sorry
My poppy, I'm your mommy

Is it real hon, if it's really real
(Let's chill)
Maybe pop an X pill
(How does sex feel?)
Come and get your next thrill
(You the raw deal)
Yo, I'm sayin' if your man won't
(Mr. Meth will)

That's amore', all day, mind over matter
And my forte' is foreplay, sex on a platter
Have it your way, then who, serve you everything on the menu
And all that freak shit that you into

Sweet lady, you drive me half crazy
Maybe, we can go half on a baby?
(On a baby?)
Poppa got a brand new bag
Hidden in the stash of his brand new Jag

Lovely, kick your shoes off and get comfy
We can bump uglies if you ain't got your monthly
Yes, I, like American Pie
Tell 'em M-I-crooked letter-crooked letter-Y

Yes, it's real baby
Got me so crazy
Light my fire dirty
Like the way you serve me
Stimulate my body
Crunk just like a party
Oh, you won't be sorry
My poppy, I'm your mommy

M-E-T-H-O-D, Man
M-I-S-S-Y, I am
I came came to bang bang the boogie
I see you lookin' to bang out my nookie
You want my cookies I baked for you rookies
Work hard they want me to bang bang and stick me
If you want my nookie you gots to come quickly
M-E-T-H-O-D is ya wit' me?
(Mr. Meth)

Is ya wit' me?
