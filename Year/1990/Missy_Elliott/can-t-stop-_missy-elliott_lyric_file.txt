Rich Nice
Woo, c'mon
Sick, uh, huh
Yes, woo
Holla

I be thinkin' 'bout that big O
The way you used to rock it to me nice and slow
You used to do it 'til my back felt broke
You used to say give it to me, I'd say no

You used to talk that kinky s*** up in my ears
And you would buy me pink, pretty underwears
And I would moan 'cause you would make me feel nice
And you would make me feel like makin' love twice

What I'm sayin', you the man, I'm in love
And I like when you do it rough
Hey shorty, I can't get enough
Can't stop, won't stop, call me Puff

Hold me down to the ground, pick me up
Now, move it 'round, break it down, hold up
Scream loud, black and proud, let's f***, come on
Nine to five, do it live, sho' nuff

I be thinkin' 'bout the way you do it good
I like it 'cause you raised in the hood
You put your back into it
I tell you no, change my mind, then I do it

You cute, you fine, you fire
I'm the boss, do the job, you hired
Heather Hunter must've got me inspired
To work for hours, fall asleep, get you tired 'cause

I can't stop thinkin' 'bout you
Or the way you do what you do
With you, I cannot lose
I put it down like some brand new shoes

I can't stop thinkin' 'bout you
The way you do what you do
With you, I cannot lose
Now, let me put it down

I be thinkin 'bout the way you do it good
I be thinkin' 'bout the way you do it good
I be thinkin' 'bout the way you do it good

He wan' take me to a hotel, see if it's good
If the n**** smale, when I put it down
He like, oh, yeah
Taste like apples and a bag of pears

Right here, right there, everywhere
To the bed, to the kitchen, in the wooden chair
He like to hear me moan like, mmm
Boy's in the zone and I don't care

Sittin' on his lap, pullin' on my track
He piggidy, piggidy, piggidy, piggy my back
In fact, no slack, damn, he the mack
He ain't got to work me like dat

I can't stop thinkin' 'bout you
Or the way you do what you do
With you, I cannot lose
I put it down like some brand new shoes

I can't stop thinkin' 'bout you
The way you do what you do
With you, I cannot lose
Now, let me put it down

I'm the boss, I'm the boss
I'm the boss, do the job, you hired
I'm the boss
I'm the boss, do the job, you hired

What I'm sayin', you the man, I'm in love
And I like when you do it rough
Hey shorty, I can't get enough
Can't stop, won't stop, call me Puff

Hold me down to the ground, pick me up
Now, move it 'round, break it down, hold up
Scream loud, black and proud, let's f***, come on
Nine to five, do it live, sho' nuff
