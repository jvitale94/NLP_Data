My style can't be duplicated or recycled
This chick is a sick individual
Sick tape, volume two!
Believe it!
Hoh! Hoh!
Let me switch up the game

I drink that cognac
Step back â€~cause I might put it on ya
I go deep, so deep till you sleep
Count sheep wake ya up from fucking all week

You don't want me have to show ya
How freak bitch act when I ain't sober
Word up, I'm tore up, sho nuff
I ain't scared to take it off
(Tell the freak to take it off)

Tipsy and I feel good
(Feel good)
Black dudes got big woods
Into it, I do it, I dud it
If you really, really want it
Then nigga stop frontin'
(Stop frontin')

Hey boy you know I'm your type
(Your type)
5'2 and wear my jeans real tight
My curves they swerve so superb
My word is my word and I came to serve

We run this
(Run this)
We run this
(Run this)
We run this
Oh, oh, oh

It don't matter where you from it's where you at
And if you came to freak-a-leak better bring your hat

East coast, west coast
Down south, represent your coast
Yeah we run it, yeah we run it
Y'all don't want it 'cause my coast run it

Oh, we run this shit
We run this shit

Wanna pull my hair? Break my back?
For the right money might sit in your lap
Back to back, I can't even keep track
It's a fact the freaks love to get slapped

Suck my toes, I need a back rub
I don't come to do it I just wanna be touched
Look at how y'all makin' me blush
I'm enough to go around so people don't push

Wanna run that tush in the bush
Don't my diamonds look real good?
And they shine so hard that he glittas
So many karats they look like crittas

And we can do it all night
Take a flashlight to see up in my windpipe
I like to keep a nigga hype
I wanna know, can you handle my mic?

We run this
(Run this)
We run this
(Run this)
We run this
Oh, oh, oh

It don't matter where you from it's where you at
And if you came to freak-a-leak better bring your hat

East coast, west coast
Down south, represent your coast
Yeah we run it, yeah we run it
Y'all don't want it 'cause my coast run it

Oh, we run this shit
We run this shit

Any hustlas in the party y'all?
(Hell ya)
If you's a pimp let me see ya party on
(Hell ya)
Oh strippas take yo clothes off
(Hell ya)
Y'all superstars, y'all don't need no bodyguards
(Hell ya)

Nigga I Bogart
A lot of rappers fake it way too hard
Pull up to the club in a rental car
Where the freaks at?
Freaks at da bar where da hard drinks are

Don't start, if you don't want beef
Don't take it that far with a superstar
I got my foot on the clutch, see me bounce my butt
Misdemeanor too much and I don't give a fuck

We run this
(Run this)
We run this
(Run this)
We run this
Oh, oh, oh

It don't matter where you from it's where you at
And if you came to freak-a-leak better bring your hat

We run this
(Run this)
We run this
(Run this)
We run this
Oh, oh, oh

Represent your coast and act like you know
Know how to act before you step your two feet in the do'

Volume two
Wicked
This shit is sick
Big shout out to Mobb Deep
