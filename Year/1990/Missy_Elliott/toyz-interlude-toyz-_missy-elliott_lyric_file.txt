Whatchu mean I don't need you no more?
'Cause I don't!
I gotta bag full of toyz and I don't need none of your boys
So you can hit every chick on the block
'Cause I'm gon' be alright once I turn this power on, ya dig?

(Toyz!)
You don't get the job done when I need a little loving
So I gotta do it myself and if I wanna feel something
So I grab me a toy, 'lil boo ain't buggin'
Well, now I want some affection and you ain't giving me nothing, no, no

A toy, every girl must have a toy, the way it make you feel
(Every girl has a toy now, baby)
A toy, every girl must have a toy, the way it make you feel
(Uh, c'mon)

I keep my butterfly close when you don't wanna be bothered
Don't come waking me up, 'cause I ain't giving you nada
'Cause I got me a toy, and it works for me, yeah
  (Toy)
And it lasts longer than the battery, so you best believe that

A toy, every girl must have a toy, the way it make you feel
(Every girl has a toy now, baby)
A toy, every girl must have a toy, the way it make you feel
(Uh, c'mon)

A toy, every girl must have a toy, the way it make you feel
(Every girl has a toy now, baby)
A toy, every girl must have a toy, the way it make you feel

I used to wish that you would love me
And fantasize on how we, we used to be
Until I discovered something better than you
I don't need, no need, need your loving

You wanna come home late at night
Touchin' and feelin' all over me
But I don't need no help in pleasing me
Oh, ho

A toy, every girl must have a toy, the way it make you feel
(Every girl must have a toy)
A toy, every girl must have a toy, the way it make you feel
(Uh, c'mon)

How could I miss you baby, I didn't even know you was gone
It's obvious you're not needed in the bedroom anymore
I'm just keeping myself occupied
Like all women do when they are taking a bath
And when you leave, make sure you don't slam the door
Because you'll fuck up my concentration
(Toy!)
