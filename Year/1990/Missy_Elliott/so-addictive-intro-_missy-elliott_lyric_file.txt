{I know some of y'all sick of songs y'all be hearin' on the radio
So me an' Timbaland gon' give that shit you never heard before
It's like drinkin' liquor or weed or x whatever does you the best
My beats, are so addictive
See if you're ridin' down the street
And you're bout to roll that shit up
Oh nah you ain't smokin' that stank of shit up in my car
Get your feet off my dashboard
Oh yeah you wanna get krunk though?
Well pop this CD in right here and take a hit at me
My album is so addictive
Man bump this ballad shit}
