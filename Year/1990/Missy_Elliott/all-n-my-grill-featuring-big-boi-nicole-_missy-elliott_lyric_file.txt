Uh, hit me

Don't explain, you never change
Same old thing, same old game
Say ya want to be wit' me
But show me my ring, baby, let me think

I been in the cold
Story untold, about to unfold
How do you expect me
To ever believe you won't be wit' me?

Why you all in my grill?
(Why you all in)
Can you pay my bills?
  (Can you pay my bills?)

Let me know if you will?
(Let me know, know)
'Cuz a chick gotta live
  (A chick like me, I got to live)

Talk is talk and talk is cheap
Tell it to her, don't say it to me
'Cuz I know I'm in control
See, tricks are for kids and boo, I'm too old

Go 'head with your games
Don't ever come back to me again
Where you go, remember me
I'm the best thing in history

Why you all in my grill?
(Why, why, why?)
Can you pay my bills?
  (Can you pay my bills?)

Let me know if you will?
(Let me know, boy, boy)
'Cuz a chick gotta live
  (A chick got to live, oh yeah)

Third time
(Third time)
I moved you in, took you back
In my life
(I was a fool)
I don't know what's wrong with me

Third time
(Third time)
I moved you in, took you back in my life
(Ooh yeah, yeah)

Why you all in my grill?
(All in my grill)
Can you pay my bills?
  (Can you pay my bills? Yeah)

Let me know if you will
(Let me know if you will)
'Cuz a chick gotta live
(Oh, yeah)

Why you all in my grill?
Can you pay my bills?
(Ooh, pay my bills)

Let me know if you will
  (Let me know, let me know baby, baby)
'Cuz a chick gotta live
(Chick like me, I got to live)

If you want me, where's my dough?
Give me money, buy me clothes
No need for talking, have my dough
Where's my money? Where's my clothes?

If you want me, where's my dough?
Give me money, buy me clothes
No need for talking, have my dough?
Where's my money? Where's my clothes?

Why you all in my grill? I'm thinkin' it's time to chill
But you on a drill, though
I couldn't even step out the baby blue Bonneville
'Cuz you be tryin' to kill my hoe, my girlfriend

And people around me is tellin' me that you's a stalker
Like Darth Vader takes a Skywalker
I told you I was the street talker, it ain't my fault
You dirty, your Victoria's Secret's and your Frederick's
You wanted the Waldorf Astoria but instead I took you to Cedrick's

To entertain you, to give you to the G and never claim you
Me and Missy, we get it straight pissin'
Oh yeah, we puffin' on one of them thangs too

You blamin' who? You namin' who?
I know you ain't bringin' that lame crew
Big Boi, they the phat sacks
She pretty D, all they same, boo

But I'm backed by the Dungeon Family
So you can go 'head wit' all that stabbin' me
'Cuz I will jab thee and slam thee
And Bobby Boochet yo' ass, G, yeah, yeah, huh
