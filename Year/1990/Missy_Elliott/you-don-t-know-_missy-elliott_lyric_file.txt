You Don't Know
[Missy]
Now see, the one thing I like about the niggas
Is that they can fess up to one of they boys
That they been sleepin' wit' the same chick, and laugh about it
But see, a woman, could never admit to another woman
That she been sleepin' wit' her man
Cuz if that ever happened to me
I would call your house and be like, yo 

Don't you gotta man
Why you fuckin' wit' mine
See, I been through bad times
Get yo' mind off mines
You must be lonely
Why you messin' wit' me
But it won't be easy
To get my baby
