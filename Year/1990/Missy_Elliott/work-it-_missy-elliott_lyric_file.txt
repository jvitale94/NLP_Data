{Yeah this is Missy Elliott
I hope ya'll enjoyin' what ya'll hearin' so far
Ya know I was sittin' here thinkin' like Big Daddy Cane an'
Public Enemy Salt 'n' Pepper like EPMDLL
Run DMC KRS1, rock him
Most of them artists used to dance and still get respected
In the street, don't be scared to bankhead or
Ballgoller, move off 'cos I can't show Michael Jackson
Forty three million, shoot everybody had a zipper jacket
An' half o' these thugs had a glove to match it feel me
Yo, its ok though, you know if you wanna be hard and ice grilled
An' Harlem shake at the same time, whatever, let's just have fun
Its Hip Hop man, this is Hip Hop}
