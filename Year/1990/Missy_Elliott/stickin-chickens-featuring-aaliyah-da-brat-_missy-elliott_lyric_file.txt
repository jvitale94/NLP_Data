What you got Boo?

I was in love wit you
And you couldn't do no wrong in my eyes
When I found out the scoop on you
It was still too hard for me to realize

That I needed to be through wit you
'Cuz you're the reason I can't eat or sleep
All the girls you runnin' through
Used to be best friends, down wit me

When I'm gone you're alone
You stickin' them chickens â€~til I get home
When I'm home you're wit me
Kissin' on my ass, tryna be wit me

Well, it's done, this I know
Seen it for myself, I'ma let you know
You don't play, games wit me
But before I go, betta leave my dough

I no fool for you
But you seem to think my love's a joke, it ain't a joke boo
I get no love from you like all these times I did before
I think I'll pass on you 'cuz of the way you been actin' lately
I get no cash from you, if you want me to stay, you must be cra-crazy

When I'm gone you're alone
You stickin' them chickens â€~til I get home
When I'm home you're wit me
Kissin' on my ass, tryna be wit me

Well, it's done, this I know
Seen it for myself, I'ma let you know
You don't play, games wit me
But before I go, betta leave my dough

Dedication, it was just a bad relation, yes it was, yes it was
When I think it cuts my insides
The tears, they fall deep down from my eyes
Dedication, it was jus a bad relation, yes it was, yes it was
When I think it cuts my insides
The tears, they fall deep down from my eyes

Doo doo doo, doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo, doo doo doo, say what?
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo, Da Brat

I want it al' from the motherfuckin' house, down to the dogs
You trickin' off with these chickens, I thought you ain't have no flaws
Keep yo dick in they jaws, Peter shoulda stayed in his draws
Now, I'm out the door and you can't claim me no more
The loss is yours

How you gonna slumber wit' a bitch I'm supposed to be cool wit'?
Went to grade school wit', couldn't pay me to believe you hit it
To think I footed all the bills and now you breakin'
Stop accusin' me of that dumb shit I don't even participate in

You wasted my valuable time there's money to make
Scared to set foot in another relationship 'cuz of the heartache
Heartbreak Hotel no not Faith, Kelly and Whitney
No it's Brat, Aaliyah and Missy You miss me 'cuz we finished

I'll just keep the keys to the 20 inch rim ride with the TVs in it
You don't need it, beat it, it's mine
Kiss my ass like your heart was in it stupid ass
Keep stickin' them chickens, send Peter straight to the clinic nigga

See, I'ma give you your props tho
You like a bad ass motherfucker
Runnin' two bitches at one time
When I'm flyin' out, she flyin' in

Sayin' the same shit, spittin' the same game
Who the fuck you think I am?
Willy Limpdick or somebody, forget you man
That's why us bitches gonna stick together, bitch
