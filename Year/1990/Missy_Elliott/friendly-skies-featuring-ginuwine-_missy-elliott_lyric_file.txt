Kiss me, hold me, the weatherman says
It's gonna be cold tonight
Whatever man
Whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever
Whatever man you wanna do
I'll be the pilot, don't miss your flight

I'm stewardess of the plane
Can you feel the turbulence and maintain
Please refrain stay in your seats
Until we reach the game

I'm stewardess of the plane
Can you feel the turbulence and maintain
Please refrain stay in your seats

Take me higher
Let's just go for a little joy ride
Whatever man
Whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever
Let's stay buckled up
And let's make love across the friendly skies

I'm passenger of this plane
I feel the turbulence, I maintain
I will refrain stay in my seat
Till I reach the game

I'm passenger of this plane
I feel the turbulence, I maintain
I will refrain, I stay in my seat

I want you
Heh, baby, want you
I really, really, wanna fuck you
I sure enough wanna fuck you

I want you, yes I do
Baby, baby, I want you
I really, really, wanna fuck you
I sure enough wanna fuck you

Is there anything that you want
Is there anything that you need
Call on me, Ginuwine
Call on me, Ginuwine

Is there anything that you want
Is there anything that you crave
Call on me, Ginuwine

'Cause I'm a passenger of your plane
Yeah

Missy fly with me
Missy fly with me, fly with me
Missy drive with me, check it out, check it out
Missy drive with me, drive with me
