You ready, B?
Let's go get, um

Look for me, young B, crusin' down the west side highway
Doing what we like to do your way
Eyes behind shade, this necklace the reason
All of my dates been blind dates
But today I got my thourest girl with me
I'm mashin' the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel
It's true to the heart, she rides with me the new Bobby and Whitney
The only time we don't speak is during sex and the city

She gets carrie fever but as soon as the show is over
She's right back to being my soulger
'Cuz mommy's a rider and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gonna stop both us
Whatever she lacks I'm right over her shoulder
When I'm off track mommy is keeping my focused
So let's lock this down like supposed to be
The 0-3 Bonnie and Clide, Hove and B
(Holla)

All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
(Me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride till the very end is me and my boyfriend
(Me and my boyfriend)

All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
(Me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride till the very end is me and my boyfriend
(Me and my boyfriend)

The problem is, you dudes treat the one that you're lovin'
With the same respect that you treat the one that you're hopin'
That ain't about nothin'
If you're ever mad about somethin' it won't be that
Oh no, it won't be that with no beatch, oh no, you won't see that
And no, I ain't perfect, nobody's walking the earth surfaces
But girlfriend work with the kid

I keep you workin' at Hermain Burginbag
Monolo bline timbs, aveaterlins, 600 drops, her cades Benz
The only time you were burbery to swim
And I don't have to worry, only worry is him
She do anything necessary for him
And I'll do anything necessary for her
So don't let the necessary occur
(Yep)

All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
(Me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride till the very end is me and my boyfriend

If I was your girlfriend
I'll be there for you if somebody hurts you
Even if somebody takes you away from me
(Yeah, hee)
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
So I put this on my life

Nobody or nothing will ever come between us
And I promise to give my life and all of my trust
If you were my boyfriend
I'll put this on my life, the air that I breath, in all that I believe
And I promise to give my life and all of my trust
If you were my boyfriend

All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
