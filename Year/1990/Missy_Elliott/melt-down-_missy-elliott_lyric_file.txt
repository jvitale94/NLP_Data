Bet it, bet it tastes like candy
Bet it, bet it tastes like candy
Bet it tastes like candy

I broke up wit my ex, I couldn't take his sarcasm
Every time we bone, I had to fake an orgasm
Moanin' and groanin', tried to make him feel manly
I'd rather use my toys, plus my hands come in handy

I finally told him that my heart was somewhere else
Whenever we sexed, I wished that he was someone else
That dude that approached me at the bar the other night
That be the mister right and hot enough to melt some ice

I think I'm in love, like Beyonce be with Jigga
It's not his major figure that want him to be my nigga
He got that magic stick that make my little pussy quiver
Juices runnin' like a river, slowly down my kitty litter

Boy, I'm so glad I found a nigga like you
A thug like you to make a girl say, oh
Hope he feel as strong as my poor heart do
Wit you by my side, it's like I'm drunk off boo

If you be my man, only my man
I wouldn't mind tastin' your magic stick, magic stick
If you don't cheat or sleep around
Ain't nothin' wrong wit tastin' your magic stick

I bet it taste like candy, made to melt in my mouth
I know you got plenty, baby, you the shit now, what you workin' wit?
Candy, made to melt in my mouth, I know you got plenty
I like the way, I like the way, I like the way, I like the way

(Work that magic stick, work that magic stick)
I like the way you work ya stick, boo, the way you work it like voodoo
  (Work that magic stick)
The way you wind and you wind and you grind
  (Oh, oh, oh)

Don't stop the way you work your stick, baby
  (Work that magic stick, work that magic stick)
The way you work your stick, baby
    (Work that magic stick)
Keep on and keep on and keep on and keep goin'

My ex boyfriend had to go, he didn't know how to work that magic stick
(Magic, magic, magic)
But I found a guy that sure do, love is so true his love is classic
Yeah, ooh

I bet it taste like candy, made to melt in my mouth
I know you got plenty, baby, you the shit now, what you workin' wit?
Candy, made to melt in my mouth, I know you got plenty
I like the way, I like the way, I like the way, I like the way

I like the way you work ya stick, boo, the way you work it like voodoo
  (Work that magic stick, work that magic stick)
The way you wind and you wind and you grind
  (Work that magic stick, oh, oh, oh)

Don't stop the way you work your stick, baby
  (Work that magic stick, work that magic stick)
The way you work your stick, baby
    (Work that magic stick)
Keep on and keep on and keep on and keep goin'

I could play Janet, you could play J.D
If you like Beyonce, you could play Jay-Z
Check for them other chicks 'cos they not me
They're just some copy cats, there's only one Missy

M to the I, double S, don't test
I'm hard as the cushion on a bullet proof vest
But you got me whipped like slaves in the days
You're cool as the shade and ice and lemonade

I think I wanna marry you, baby, I will carry
This is necessary and on the contrary
You be mister right and mister legendary
The more I fall in love, the more it gets scary, come on

(Work that magic stick, work that magic stick)
I like the way you work ya stick, boo, the way you work it like voodoo
  (Work that magic stick)
The way you wind and you wind and you grind
  (Oh, oh, oh)

Don't stop the way you work your stick, baby
  (Work that magic stick, work that magic stick)
The way you work your stick, baby
    (Work that magic stick)
Keep on and keep on and keep on and keep goin'

I think I'm in love, love, like Beyonce be with Jigga
I think I'm in love, like Beyonce be with Jigga
