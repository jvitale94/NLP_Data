Just young national
Dog is on sabbatical

Fall attention, fallin' in
CNN and all this shit
Why y'all cool with the fuckery
Trump and SNL hilarity
Troublesome times kid, no times for comedy
Blood clout, you doing
Bullshit you spewing
As if this country ain't already ruined
And look at these he's mumbling, fumbling, swearing
They degrade us
Online they debate us, if we different, then we're haters
We ended our hiatus as dogs looking for food
The nucleus is here now 


Toleration for devastation, got a hunger for sin
Every nation, Obama nation, let the coroner in
Crooked faces, red and blue laces for the color of men
Just embrace it and die alone, song, a Revelation
Reverends and cattles racing
Devils and demons and Deuteronomy
Fumigate all economy, illuminate broken dreams
And manifest all this sanity
Look around, sayonara tomorrow, he's just blood on the ground


Sayonara tomorrow, he's just blood on the ground
(Conrad Tokyo, a far road, pistachio)
Sayonara tomorrow, he's just blood on the ground
(Conrad Tokyo, a far road, pistachio)
Sayonara tomorrow, he's just blood on the ground
(Conrad Tokyo, a far road, pistachio)
Sayonara tomorrow, he's just blood on the ground
(Conrad Tokyo, a far road, pistachio)
Sayonara tomorrow, he's just blood on the ground
Conrad Tokyo, a far road, pistachio
Conrad Tokyo, a far road, pistachio
Conrad Tokyo, a far road, pistachio)


Conrad Tokyo, a far road, pistachio
Conrad Tokyo, a far road, pistachio
Conrad Tokyo, a far road, pistachio
Conrad Tokyo, a far road, pistachio
