Ain't about love no mo'
It's all about ends
Only friend I know


(Love)
That's a definition tainted
Sink deep into your speakers I'll explain it
Got a group of niggas you don' grew up with
(And a) selection of bitches that you fuck with
You find out who's your friends is real quick
Coming up short on your next months rent
Ain't nobody trying to help to get you out your bind
Ain't that just like your homeboys fuckin' you all the time
What is love?
Its just another four letter word like
Stick stuck kicked to the curve
Especially when you got someone your programmed with
Switchin' up on ya' every other chance he gets
So to hell with this thing called love
Cuz yo' there really ain't no love here
Its just a heart full of blood yea
No tears gots to let my nuts hangs on the solo
Do my dirt on low low fasho thou
I break it down to you niggas real simple
Your friends will come and go like pimples
And love ain't never loved no god dam body
Look what love and friendship got the don john gotti
Sitting in a jail cell waiting to die
And if you ask me I'll quickly reply

Ain't about friends
Ain't about love no mo'
It's all about ends
Only friend I know


Used to be a tight crew
Til the boat started sinking
And the mentality "was get up out this bitch and start drinking"
And niggas stood around on solid ground
Watching from a distance as the mighty vessel went down
Now friends of the captain didn't let him know the damage
The second in charge held the position
But couldn't manage
To piece it back together again
But these were the people that we call friends
Cold winds steadily blowing would make the matters worst
The ho is swallowing water and mechanisms don't work
Destroyed by the dirt truth is love hurts
Friendship ain't shit so get all that your worth
So when your time comes to set your sail
You won't be digested by the big wet whale
Make sure you tie down all your loose ends
And beware of your so called friends

Ain't about friends
Ain't about love no mo'
It's all about ends
Only friend I know


I used to think you would ride with me
Side by side in my 5 50
But when my shit got sticky you was iffy
Turned on me just when I thought I had a homie
You fled this on me no you behaving like you don't know me
Its funny how the money change a friendship
That's why I'm seeing everything just like a business
Cuz witness when its all said and done
I could look back and laugh at this whole mess with no regrets
A life time of what was lost
And a whole truth forgotten
When the loves gone the hearts left rotten
Punctured and destroyed by the beast within
Fuck friends let the choir rise at least the hymns

Ain't about friends
Ain't about love no mo'
It's all about ends
Only friend I know
