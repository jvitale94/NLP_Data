There's a man who live the life of danger
To everyone he meets stays stranger
With every move he makes, another chance he takes
Odds are he won't live to see tomorrow


He's secret agent man amazin man
Check how he walks, how he talks, how he lays his plan
Secret agent man advance his game
They give you a number and take away your name

Secret agent man amazin man
Check how he walks how he talks how he lays the plan
Secret agent man advance his game
They give you a number and take away your name


They wear pretty face that you find
A pretty face can hide evil mind
Be careful what you say, or you'll give yourself away
Odds are you won't live to see tomorrow
Agent man amazin man
Check how he walks how he talks how he lays his plan
Secret agent man advance his game
They give him a number and took away his name


He's secret agent man amazin man
Check how he walks how he talks how he lays his plan
Secret agent man advance his game
They give you a number and take away your name

Yea, (secret) yea, (secret) yea (secret) yea, (secret)


Secret agent man amazin man
Check how he walks how he talks how he lays his plan

Oh no, who let the wrong word slip
While kissin the persuasive lips

Uh secret agent man
Uh, uh, more bullet proof than a spook set by the door
More legend than 007, more raw

"Watch Out"
