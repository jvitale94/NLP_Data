


Its much more than a March
It will be the beginin of a movement
Millions more movement; let us begin

Tell us what you hear!


Dear people of the globe
I hoped you in good health
By the time my voice hit you
I hope in all wells wit you
My mission is to bail wit you
Touch upon some real issues
Senators, Government Officials
Sit at the conference and listen
Have a Coke and a Mineral water
And say reminisce, George L. Jackson
Malcolm X last win when I'm rappin
Americans, Africans, Asians, Russians, and Arab men
Send your clergymen to journey wit Nas from Queens projects
I promise unforgettable experience
compare me wit, Imhotep get M.O. Dep
History was stolen, get in my zone
what makes the power that beef? less gangsta then Al Campone
Rosetta stone was stolen like Chicago was
Think I'm a thug?, lets talk about some conquerors
Napoleon, Sun Tzu, Genghis Khan
Hitler, Edi Amin, I'm the tale of the hunt
Let's bring back to the cat that invented the gun
From the Indians all the way to the Pentagon
I'm sittin on Capitol Hill
I'm composin this rhyme, guarantee to make all of y'all feel
The beauty that was trapped under siege
Believe in yourself you'll be free, take it from me


We will not surrender or we will not back down
We keep overactin
Throw a fist for black power
Tell us what you hear
Why do we March? to protest Government policy
We March because the time to fight back
We March for education
Throw a fist for black power
Tell us what you hear
Why do we March? We March to save the soul of America


The rejection of what's right could mean you in denial
It either breaks you or makes you becomes hostile
I swallow many lives before tastin the truth
In the beginin there was darkness, beautiful you
How will life be without night?, no tranquility?
No way to get away and rest no stability?
I can't see the sky without the moon and the stars
The sunlight; blockin everythin the King I'm involved
People worship the Madonna in the shrines in Spains
I'm proud to share the same blood type in veins
The holy mother...the loneliest color remains
Can't be tamperin, die loot the chains
They try make you not want it, make you run from it
The wickest men, want the ebony punish
It's so seductive it's sensuous in my clutches
Hot as fire when Moses saw burnin bushes
So abused and misused and mistreated
Makin men wanna get drunk and get weed it
People wild when she comes out pull out and party
Catch her body, fornicate some start beef
Chain reaction cuz it's in the air
The lost tribe scattered everywhere
From the North thru West Hemisphere
Scientist and Archaeologist conceal the obvious
The dead, livin and little children over time of this
Obsession coursin, every essence of magnetism every organism when it come to it
All question 'bout Resurrection and your connection with God
It's answered wit the beast in your heart


We will not surrender or we will not back down
We keep overactin
Throw a fist for black power
Tell us what you hear
Why do we March? to protest Government policy
We March because the time to fight back
We March for education
Throw a fist for black power
Tell us what you hear
Why do we March? We March to save the soul of America
