Puff: 
I don't give a fuck, yeah yeah yeah 
As we proceed to five you what you need 
Queen Bee muthafuckas, BIG muthafuckas 
Junior Mafia muthafuckas, yeah yeah yeah yeah 

Lil' Kim: 
Bitches wanna front on em 
Know not to come on em 
I keep 10 glocks, 10 rocks up and in front of em 
Like they spraying somethin', like they saying somethin' (you ain't saying shit) 
I get my bark on like DMX or somethin'(what) 
My music's like Louis, stiff eighty-four 
Yours is like Evander, 77th floor 
Thanks to Tae-bo, I'm 32 and 0 
Then I catch a knock out, then swing and pop out 
2 for 5 spots, I tear the rocks out 
Pop the tops out, then clear the spot out 
Take a nigga or a bitch (uh), you don't want no problems 
My revolver is a quick problem solver 
Don't never think I'm slippin, bitch I ain't dumb 
I carry a stun gun inside of my hair bun 
Hatin' ass niggaz, I treat you like a bitch 
Strap on a fake dick and stick you where you shit HA! 

Chorus: 
Come my people, come and hail the queen (Y'all bitches ain't shit) 
Everybody let me hear you sing (There's only one queen, my queen, the Queen 
Bee) 
Come my people, come and hail the queen (Come on niggas, we took a little 
break) 
Everybody let me hear you sing (You thought we was gon stop, we will never 
stop) 

Lil' Kim: 
I took 3 years off to map my shit out 
Switched up my game plan 
Get closer to god 
Give me an inch I'll take a yard 
Oh yall didn't know but yall knew I was coming back real hard 
By the power that's invested in me, faith rested in me 
I can't quit now, too much money's invested in me 
To my nigga B.I., this ones for you baby 
These niggaz wanna be kings, 
What the fuck is these niggaz crazy? 
I'm a hold da spot for ya  yeah 
Keep it locked for ya  yeah 
Rock for ya pop 
Ain't a nigga I won't drop for ya 
Bitches want my title, there aint a slot for ya 
It's a cold whole world, I'll keep it hot for ya 
What..Y'all cats know who I am 
What..I love those who love Lil Kim 
What..I'm back again, the mic beater, the dick beater 
The pussy skeeter 
Do or die! 

Chorus: Come my people, come and hail the queen(Queen Bee, 
Everybody let me hear you sing (To my niggaz) 
Come my people, come and hail the queen (I don't think the understand) 
Everybody let me hear you sing (I don't think they understand Puff) 


Lil' Kim: 
Blink 5 carats on the fuck you finger 
And the hataz in the crowd, give 'em the "fuck you finger 
Think you can ball with the queen, handle the reprecussions 
Our guns bust the English and the Russians 
Nas pararoba cata reba ne toche gababin dabunce das padonya 
Niggaz stand in line pay a fee for me to kiss em 
Twenty-one's the lucky number once the e is in the system 
One night with the QB and niggaz need maturity 
I keep my pussy tight like the president's security 
I'm sometimey, that's right, I change like the year 
I win chips from a casino, and throw em in the air 
I'm the queen, I got special priviledges 
We ain't equivalent, how dare you insult my intelligence? 
Now, I win awards, you like the words to this song 
You thought I was gone, but the queen LIVES ON! 


As we proceed to give you what you need... 
All my niggaz, all my niggaz, wild the fuck out (Wild the fuck out) 
All my bitches, all my bitches, wild the fuck out (All my bitches wild the fuck out) 
Everybody, everybody wild the fuck out (Throw your muthafuckin' hand in the air) 
The Queen is back baby!!!!!
