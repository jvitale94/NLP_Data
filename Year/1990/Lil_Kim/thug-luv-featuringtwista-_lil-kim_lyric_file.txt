Here come a bitch with the fly puss
An' a nigga with the fly dick
In the Mickey an' Mallory mode
Rollin' through the streets on 24s
On krunk screamin', "Die bitch"

'Bout to shut yo' shit down
Anybody that opposes to payin' us a fee falls
If the straps don't bleed y'all
We put stitches in yo' motherfuckin' dome
Like a league brawl, come an' roll with us

Take a journey to the realm of the truth
When I bust this, it's the Duke an' the Duchess
Leavin' haters 'buked an' on crutches
Niggaz, you cannot touch this

It's a new collaboration of Thug Luv
Between the Thug Queen an' the Thug Lord
More power than a drug lord
Meant to be because we love each other
The way we love war

Gotta rider, bet hug yours 'cause I'm full of ambition
An' ammunition an' a 50 like I smoked a sticky stack of hash
Ain't no missin' on no critical condition
Murderin' is the mission an' we can bust a itchy atcha ass

Feel the flow when I drop it, don't when to stop it
I'm goin' to pockets an' layin' bodies down
Feel adrenaline from me an' Kim an' 'em
We got it sewed from Brooklyn to Chi Town

See the artillery, we don't fuck around with silly games
Plenty thangs, nigga, plus I got an illy aim
Stick 'em up, steal his chain
Then I spill his brain, then I feel his pain

Some of the consequences
When you dealin' with a plug thug
An' I'm backed up by the Queen
We gon' take over the world
Whatchu know about Thug Luv?

You can't fuck with us, do it like a hustler
Gotta keep it gangsta, can't no one collide with us
All my true thugs an' all my real bitches
Won'tcha come an' ride with us?

Do it like a hustler
Gotta keep it gangsta, can't no one collide with us
All my true thugs an' all my real bitches
Won'tcha come an' ride with us?

It's the T W I S to the T A
K to the motherfuckin' I M
'Bout to shut yo' shit down
Other albums come out, ain't nobody gon' buy them

Now who gon' deny them? I'm scared of myself
Don't nobody wanna try Kim
Y'all know you done fucked up
Now wassup? Y'all better come roll with us

Who's you, mister? It's Lil' Kim an' Twista
An' we about this, for those who doubt this
The game is ours
We gon' run you up out this

What a wonderful feelin' when you're stealin' a million
But the billion jackpot's what I aim for
Get your hands in the air, put 'em up, keep 'em high
Don't want no problems, just gimme what I came for

Pull up on your block, eight straight Hummers
'Bout to have it locked, eight straight summers
Bank account hold eight straight numbers
Ain't no room for you whack newcomers

We the people's choice because we kick that
Nasty hardcore shit that you wanna hear
Can't fuck with us
Hands down, we win 'Best murder rap of the year'

Pounds to the misters, hugs for the miss
Bombs in the mail, sealed with a kiss
All my bitches pop that thing like this
All my niggaz wave that bling on the wrist

Some of the consequences
When you dealin' with a plug thug
An' I'm backed up by the Duke
We gon' take over the world

Kim, is yo' flow hot? Like a gun shot
Twist, is yo' flow cold? Well I think so
Kim, do you got dranks? Crist' by the box
Twist, do you got smokes? Well I got 'dro
Now baby, we can roll

Do it like a gangsta, creepin' like a murderer
Strapped while I roll on chrome
Lookin' for the ones we at war with
When we see 'em we gon' aim for your dome

Hear me ma, we can run this earth together
Come up worse than ever
Havin' big dreams while we back up this work together

Let's set up shop on the block now
Takin' over yo' tip even if we gotta slang dubs
Go to war because I love blood, with a queen by my side
Whatchu know about Thug Luv?

You can't fuck with us
Do it like a hustler, Lil' Kim an' Twista
Might as well ride with us
Male groupies, girl groupies
They're all gon' side with us

Whatcha gon' do, it's the Duke an' the Duchess
You need to give it up
We gon' take over the world
