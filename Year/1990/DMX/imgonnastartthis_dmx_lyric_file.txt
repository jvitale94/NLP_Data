I want everybody who can see me, to put ya motherfuckin Xs in the air!
Grrr... You Know!
When the dog is on the stage!
C'mon baby!
Y'all niggas gots to make mo motherfuckin noise to that!
C'mon! What? C'mon! C'mon! C'mon!
What? C'mon!
Now bounce! Bounce! Now bounce! Now bounce! Bounce! Bounce! Bounce! Bounce!
(DMX)
Grrr... Grrr... Grrr...
What? What? What?

One two one two, come through run through 
Gun who, oh you don't know what the 
(Gun do!) 
Some do, those that know are real quiet 
Let me think you wanna try it, fuck around and 
(Start a riot!)
Niggas gonna buy it, regardless because I'm the hardest 
rap artist and I'ma start this 
Shit up foreal, get up and feel, my words 
I make herbs split up 
(And squeal)
Ill is all I've been hearin lately 
Niggaz hate me, wanna duck tape me and make me 
put their brains on the wall, when I brawl 
Too late 
(For that 911 call)
Niggaz stay beefin but a lot of them bluffin 
But not me because I'ma nigga that can get out of them cuffs 
You think a lot of them tough 
Not just for frotin 
When I hit them niggaz like 
('What you want?')
The battle turns into a hunt 
With the dog right behind niggaz chasin em down 
We all knew that you was pussy 
But I'm 
(Tastin it now) 
And never give a dog blood 
because raw blood 
I have a dog like one bitin whatever 
(What?)
All up in ya gut 
Give it to them raw like that 
and ain't no love I do em all like that 
Four right up in they back 
Clak Clak 
Close your eyes baby, it's over 
Forget it, happened in front off your buildin but 
Nobody knows who did it
