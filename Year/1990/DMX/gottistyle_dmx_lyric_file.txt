Niggaz don't want it 
Yeah 
Ja Rule

Def Jam niggaz hah 
Mutherfuckers better stay the fuck out of our way 
Understand that, knawmean? 
We doin this shit straight gangsta style, Gotti style nigga 
Fuck y'all 

Uh, uh, uh 
Ja's the torture 
The high class, toss to D 
Grimy and gritty, outter limits in this inner city 
Niggaz is definately assed-out, fuckin wit me 
End up wit a gun in your mouth, straight cheese 
I should bust em 
Cuz see me killin you don't mean nothin 
I'll put you through a lifetime of sufferin nigga 
Then you'll learn that bridges ain't made to be burned 
Drug money is rightfully earned, well deserved 
Some rules just think, are fit for takes 
And Ja's rules make em large, that you fatefully break 
Unless you wanna get spanked, with the 9 fully loaded 
We can murder each other, meet at the Crossroads 
And if I die tonight, in the immortal words of Pac 
My niggaz gonna hunt you till you drop, believe that 
Niggaz is capable of all that, take your mom for ransom 
Give little kids back, that's the way we do things 
Never leave shells, never drop names 
Roll with the game as it change 
Ja's to blame, I'ma let this world share my pain 
In my demise you can put it on my grave 
"Here lies a lost soul of rage, seen brighter days 
And outta darkness done graduated, may he lay" 
And this I swear, here in Hell we don't play fair 
Cross the line, with my nine I'll be bringin you here 
Motherfuckers 

Check it out y'all 
Check it out, check it out 
Check it out y'all 
Check it out, check it out 
Check it out y'all 
Check it out, check it out 
Check it out y'all 

Uh, GRRRRRRRRRRRR 
I make moves that get me where I'm goin 
Break fools that act like they ain't knowin how it's goin 
Dizown, with the dizark, cuz that's that kid 
Unmask that kid, look at that bastard kid 
That don't mind having to break shit or take shit 
And motherfucker, if you ain't me you ain't shit 
You fuckin faggot 
You know I coulda been stuck it to you 
Nigga I wasn't even think about fuckin wit you 
But I bet now I know your man is thinkin twice bout who to fuck wit 
Shit is gettin bad, I'm robbin niggaz I grew up with 
And I know it's just a matter of time before I get shot 
Or I'ma torture this niggaz little sister and make him watch 
Give a nigga a little room, now he's tryin to house shit 
But I bet you get back on some mouse shit 
When I punch you in your mouth, bitch 
Aaaah, a nigga broken off quick 
Yelllckkk! , is the sound he makes chockin off dick 
How you feel, eatin with a straw he has to suck through 
Fuck me? No fuck you, now I gotta touch you 
Fuckin bitch suckin dick like a jockstrap 
Put them glocks back 
Tryin to be the first punk motherfucker that shot back
Got that? Didn't Get? You know where you gonna be layin right? 
I'm tellin you, hah, you know what the fuck I'm sayin right? 
You will respect this, cuz it gets reckless when I cut the 
Dun-nun-Dun-nun-Dun-nun-Dun-nun, you be like "What the--Nooo!" 
But it's too late cuz the heat-seaker done found the heat 
The concrete done found your meat 
Cuz hittin the ground still hot from steam comin off 
Eyes rolled back in his head, coughin up chunks of flesh 
Then niggaz'll roll with his monstrous death, beatin punks to death 
Ain't nuthin left but the memory of what used to be your life 
Funeral payments, and dried up blood on my knife 
Y'all motherfuckers don't understand, when it's on it's on 
You up in the casket with some shades, cuz your eyes is gone 
I know I'm wrong, that's why I did my dirt and slid 
But you made it happen, with that bullshit you did 
Now you want peace? Well take a piece of this ammunition 
And get your ass drug out the Hudson by some old man fishin 
My mission is almost complete 
This message will self distruct in two seconds 
Beeeeeeeeeeeeeeep
