The role is roof but I'm going for it
We shaking top and real, drum still for us
And we make the move like the strongest one
You the last one and try to be the longest one
You know the difference between right or wrong so don't mix it
Whenever they hook, go fix it
If it ain't smoke, don't twix it
Just hit that nigga with the  right here and  most of you missed it
You fall out, gte the fuck back up, try to hit

Get up and try again
