

Uh, uh...uh, uh-huh


Out on the streets, where I grew up  
First thing they teach us, not to give a fuck
That type of thinking can’t get you nowhere 
Soooome-onnnne haaaas tooooo care


How I got over... where the people come apart 
Don't nobody care about cha, only thing you got is God
Out here in these streets.. if you get down on your luck 
You can stand out, with a hand out
But nobody give a fuck
Out here in these streets, every man is for himself 
They ain’t helpin noone else, it's a hazard to your health 
Livin life in these cold streets
Hey, WHO'S worryin 'bout cha, babe? 
When you whylin out, runnin 'round in these streets


Out on the streets, where I grew up (How I got over...)  
First thing they teach us, not to give a fuck (How I got o-)
That type of thinking can’t get you nowhere   (How I got over...)
Soooome-onnnne haaaas tooooo care


Yo.. 
When you on the corners, there's too much drama 
Livin with the police right behind ya
It's always more than a slight reminder 
We livin in a war zone like Rwanda 
Before I go back to the Heavenly Father 
Pray for me if it ain’t too much bother 
Whatever don't break me a-make me stronger 
I feel like I can't take too much longer
It's too much lyin, and too much fightin 
I'm all cried out 'cause I grew up cryin 
They all got a sales pitch I ain't buyin 
They tryin to convince me that I ain't tryin 
We uninspired, we unadmired 
And tired and sick of being sick and tired
of livin in the hood where the shots are fired 
We dyin to live, so to live, we dyin 
You just like I am 


Out on the streets, where I grew up (How I got over...)  
First thing they teach us, not to give a fuck (How I got o-)
That type of thinking can’t get you nowhere (Somebody, somewhere..)
Soooome-onnnne haaaas tooooo care


Somebody's gotta care..
And I swear it isn't fair
In suspended animation, we ain't tryin to go nowhere
Out here in these streets.. We're so young and all alone
We ain't even old enough, to realize we're on our own
Livin life in these hard streets
Where it's like they lost they mind
Is there anyway to find?
Are we runnin out of time out here?
Listen...
Hey, WHO'S worryin 'bout cha, babe? 
When you whylin out, runnin 'round in these streets
