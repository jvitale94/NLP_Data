Well, in the world of night terrors it's, hard to dream 
Holl'n Cash Rules Everything, let's call it (C.R.E.A.M.)
'cause when it rises to the top, you get, the finer things
Oceanfronts, rollin blunts, with model chicks
and sayin grace over lobster and steak 
like, "Please forgive us for ridin Benzes with camera plates"
Too busy lookin backwards for jackers to pump my brakes
For help sign to symbolize the lives that hunger takes
Addicted to the green, if I don't ball I'll get the shakes
I'd give it all for peace of mind, for heaven's sake
My heart's so heavy that the ropes that hold my casket break
'cause everything that wasn't for me, I had to chase
I had to chase...
 

They told me that the ends, won't justify the means
They told me at the end, don't justify the dreams
that I've had since a child, maybe I'll throw in the towel
Make my (make my) make my (make my) hardship from the world
 

Tryin to control the fits of panic
Unwritten and unraveled, it's the dead man's pedantic
Whatever, see it's really just a matter of semantics
When everybody's fresh out of collateral to damage
And, my splayin got me (praying) like a (mantis)
I begin to vanish, feel the pull of the blank canvas
I'm contemplatin, that special dedication
to whoever it concern, my letter of resignation
Fadin, back to black, my dark coronation
The heat of the day, the long robe of muerte
That soul's in the atmosphere like airplay
If there's a Heaven I can't find a (Stairway)
