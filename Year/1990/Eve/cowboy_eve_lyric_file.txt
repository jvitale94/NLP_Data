Cuz none can tame us, the game'll never drain us
Cuz we gon' stop your shine
And it remains us

And let some clown take my shine like I aint workin overtime

Erased your name with ease
And it was nothin, caught you stuntin got no room to breathe
Only into big things
All day spit game
Tryin to put my people up on paper before shit change

Tryin to get my papes right
After every show, I gotta go, I got a late flight
Thought they had us figure out
Cuz we pullin figures out

Questions start to come about
Thought my time was runnin out

We always keep it gangsta we change what y'all be talkin' bout
Some get away with bullshit

Back on the block, hustlin, scrapin money up to buy a brick
Too late, cuz it's over now
