Raping and beatings and suffering that worsens
Black human packages tied up in strings 
Black rage can come from all these kinds of things.

Black rage is founded on blatant denial, 
sweet economics, subsistent survival, 
deafening silence and social control, 
black rage is found in all forms in the soul,

When the dog bites, when the bee stings, when I’m feeling sad,
I simply remember all these kinds of things, and then I don’t fear so bad

Black rage is founded who fed us self hatred 
Lies and abuse while we waited and waited 
Spiritual treason 
This grid and it's cages 
Black rage was founded on these kinds of things 

Black rage is founded on dreaming and draining 
Threatening your freedom 
To stop your complaining 
Poisoning your water 
While they say it's raining 
Then call you mad 
For complaining, complaining 
Old time bureaucracy 
Drugging the youth 
Black rage is founded on blocking the truth 
Murder and crime 
Compromise and distortion 
Sacrifice, sacrifice 
Who makes this fortune? 
Greed, falsely called progress 
Such human contortion 
Black rage is founded on these kinds of things 

So when the dog bites 
And the bee stings 
And I'm feeling mad 
I simply remember all these kinds of things 
And then I don't fear so bad 

Free enterprise 
Is it myth or illusion 
Forcing you back into purposed confusion 
Black human trafficking 
Or blood transfusion 
Black rage is founded on these kinds of things 
Victims of violence 
Both psyche and body 
Life out of context IS living ungodly 
Politics, politics 
Greed falsely called wealth 
Black rage is founded on denying of self 
Black human packages 
Tied and subsistence 
Having to justify your very existence 
Try if you must 
But you can't have my soul 
Black rage is founded on ungodly control 
So when the dog bites 
And the beatings 
And I'm feeling so sad 
I simply remember all these kinds of things 
And then I don't feel so bad
