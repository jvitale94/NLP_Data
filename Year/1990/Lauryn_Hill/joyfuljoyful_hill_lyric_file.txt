Lord we adore Thee
God of Glory, Lord of Love
Hearts unfold like flowers before Thee
Hail Thee as the sun above
Melt the clouds of sin and sadness
Drive the dark of doubt away
Giver of immortal gladness
Fill us with the light
Fill us with the light
Oh, fill us with the light of day

Check the rhyme
Joyful, joyful
Lord we adore Thee
And in my life I put none before Thee
'Cos since I was a youngster I came to know
That you were the only way to go


So I had to grow and I come to an understanding
And I'm down with the King
So no-one commanded
You tell me "Who you down with" see
All I know is that I'm down with G.O.D
You down with G.O.D?


Yeah, you know me


You down with G.O.D?


Yeah, you know me


You down with G.O.D?


Yeah, you know me


You down with G.O.D?


Everybody


Join the mighty chorus
The mighty, mighty chorus
Which the morning stars begun
The Father of Love is reigning over us


By the way!
What have you done for Him lately
Ooooh yeah (Oh)
What have you done for Him lately
He watches over everything
So we sing!




Fill us (Fill us with the light of day Lord, oh fill
us)
Fill us (Oh we need you yes we do, ooh fill us)
Fill us (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Fill us (With the light of day Lord)
Fill us (With the light of day Lord)
Fill us (With the light of day Lord)

Fill us (We need you, we need you to Pray, we need
you, need you today)
Fill us (We need you I'm gonna say)
Fill us (Fill us, fill us, fill us, fills us!)

Fill us
Fill us with the light of day (Oh yeah)
LIGHT OF DAY!
