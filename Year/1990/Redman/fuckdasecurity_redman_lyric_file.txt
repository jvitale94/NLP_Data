

Yeah, Gilla House
Fu-fu, fu, fuck da security...


Money on my mind, doc on the grind
I ain't on Billboard tryin' to climb
Killa on set, don't press rewind
I'm like the thirty-somethin' year-old Lebron
Boy I'm fucked up, way past tipsy
Smoke on my lung, tequila on my kidney
Grown man boi, I land on the water
So move back before you get caught in the rotor
I'm like the G4 to your General Motors
Y'all take orders, red in like Otis
You're all game novice, doc's a pro
I'm a boss like I married Diana Ross!


Roll through da hood like
FUCK DA SECURITY!
Walk in the club like
FUCK DA SECURITY!
Smoke on my blunt like
FUCK DA SECURITY!
If you not da hood type?
YOU NEED SECURITY!

'Cause when I do a show, I rely on my gros, they pick me up off the flo'
(FUCK DA SECURITY!)
'Cause I'm too high and drunk from jumpin' up in da crowds
Security like: "Fuck you, yo!"
(FUCK DA SECURITY!)


That's how I roll, fuck da security
They're everywhere look, can't even urinate
I'm the last nigga that get intimidated
Don't get it then, let me reiterate
Boi I'm a hustla, throwin' them knuckles up
Walk in the restaurant, hand on your juggla
Ride in the BM, better buckle up
Dat game rumblin', bricks gon' double up
I tee off hoes, look how my putter up
Old folks say I cut her off, lil' sum sum
Only one champion and you're the runner up
Coo coo for Cocoa Puffs, watch when I perch him up
D O C, guzzlin' Hennessey
Fuck da club nigga, and FUCK SECURITY!!!!

'Cause when I do a show, I rely on my gros, they pick me up off the flo'
(FUCK DA SECURITY!)
'Cause I'm too high and drunk from jumpin' up in da crowds
Security like: "Fuck you, yo!"
(FUCK DA SECURITY!)
