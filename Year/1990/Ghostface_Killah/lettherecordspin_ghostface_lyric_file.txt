The almighty G.F.K. let’s begin
Let the record spin

Ay yo I’m back blowing dust off the vinyl
I got twelve more reasons to die, snap your spinal
Selling contracted killer with the promise of life
I hope you murder them Delucas for killing your wife
Just leave Logan and the boy, I’ll destroy their whole entourage
Blow up the cars in their garage, leave them cripple
The almighty ghost of Lester Kane
Soon to be one in the same
We insane

I resurrect him, summon the killer
The almighty G.F.K. let’s begin
Let the record spin
Let the record spin
Let the record spin
Let the record spin

I resurrect him, summon the killer
The almighty G.F.K. let’s begin
Let the record spin
Let the record spin
Let the record spin

Let’s unify and formulate a plan
Shut ’em down in the worst way
But first we have to annihilate everything attached to him
Mother and fathers, brothers and sisters, aunts and uncles
No one should survive this wicked war killers
Moulin Rouge models that bust  like Priscilla
Soon as they blow your whistle they quick to send you a missile
Down one hundred proof vodka burning your chest like kerosene
Now stop these niggas currency until they see no cream
I resurrect him, summon the killer
The almighty G.F.K. let’s begin
Let the record spin
Let the record spin
Let the record spin
Let the record spin

I resurrect him, summon the killer
The almighty G.F.K. let’s begin
Let the record spin
Let the record spin
Let the record spin
Let the record spin

So it’s your greed, Imma take your body and flesh
A human walking the earth and nothing less
Revenge is avenged when the family is diminished
You gonna rise to the heavens when our mission is finished
I’m gonna enjoy this the second time around as a chum
I wanna brutalize and torture; cause nothing but harm
Ring the alarm, throw up the flag, rise the syndicate
Deluca’s reign is over at the top, we put an end to it

I resurrect him, summon the killer
The almighty G.F.K. let’s begin
Let the record spin
Let the record spin
Let the record spin
Let the record spin

I resurrect him, summon the killer
The almighty G.F.K. let’s begin
Let the record spin
Let the record spin
Let the record spin
