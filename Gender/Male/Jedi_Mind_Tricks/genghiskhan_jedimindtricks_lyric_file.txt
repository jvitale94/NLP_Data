


You about to witness a two five Jedi Minds collabo
You know what I mean?
The God Jus Allah


Megatraum is a Martian feeding off weed and cash
I dash for my shipment of Roswell crash
You smash when you dash with the clashing ox
Saw you in half without a fucking magical box
Wet pussy always seems to splash my cock
I'm dead they just didn't leave the casket locked
Pass my block I let shots drill in your spleen
We're I'll marines with hand held killing machines
Steal dreams with the armored steel
Guard your grill
Nigga, I was brought up by the kids in Smallville
Following Allah's will, horror in the skill
Caught up in the real
Don't give me cause to kill
Nocturnal, I stroll where the darkness goes
If I had to follow the moon across the globe
With the staff and white robe
I still hold metal
Disciples who walk on glass and rose petals



Yo last rigths, we fast to blast twice


Jedi Mind 252 we mad nice


We smash mics, and blast too precise


Fast 40 days and pray for 40 nights

Yo, I'm savage
I write rhymes in pitch blackness
Any motherfucker that front, is left backless
Y'all motherfuckers just burn into ashes
Trying to step into the zone with Vinnie Paz
Is Black Sabbath
Put a slug in his grill
'Cause Jedi Mind two five thugs are for real
You ever think there might be trouble then peel
'Cause a motherfucker like me thumping to kill
Y'all better pass the mic 'cause this I'll
Y'all learn the +Facts Of Life+ from Kim Fields
I don't know how many kids my flow harms
My gun control leave y'all with no arms
Y'all love to smell the stench of dead bodies
Left in the path of the Paz and Khadafi
Five nine, tatted up, mad stocky
Animal thug who bust slugs in the lobby




I hit the turnpike on dirtbike with 2 'litas
On my way to Philly to fight for Mumia
Only thug guerillas are react to this
The laws try to destroy black activists
Half of y'all, is performers and actresses
I keep atleast a 100 grand in the mattresses
Shit so hot, soon as I write it I get indicted
I dare one y'all scared niggas to bite it
I stood in hood lobbies getting my rocks off
With longjohns and 3 pairs of socks on
Ducking from the pigs so I don't get knocked off
Or popped off, and y'all thugs are soft
It's like you're skirt get pulled up, clothes come off
Red Dragons, can't even fuck with my brain patterns
I'm all live, Pentium Plus and Benz wagons
Maki, believe me it do ring bells
If you saw me do dirt you won't live to tell
I'd lived in a cell
Did bids in hell
Held niggas at gunpoint for ransom and bail
