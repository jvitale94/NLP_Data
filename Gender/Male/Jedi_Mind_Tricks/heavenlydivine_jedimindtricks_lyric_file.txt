Jedi Mind
Heavenly Divine
Steadily Shine
Ikon The Fucking Hologram
Yo, Yo, Yo, Yo


Another Sacrificial Lamb
That died at the hands of Hologram
Send Him Into The Dungeon And Plunder His Fucking Plan
Holy Land
Who Spit The Live Shit
The Do Or Die In The Jail, Jedi Mind Shit
The Hot Shit
Live Raps Crack Your Jaw
Like Who's The Avenger And Who's At The Center Of War
I Left The Scar
So Your Crabs Would Over Sand
Mental Will Dent You And Take You To A Holy Land, Lord Know The Man
Sharp Blades Slash Your Vitals
Recitals Will Fight You And Entice You To Burn Bibles
Homicidal
Hologram Burn Churches
Murders By Sticking A Crucifix Through Your Cervix
Divine Purpose
For The Remi That's In My Thermos
Wait And See We'll Stick You With Needles That's Hypodermic
You Heard The Verdict
I'm With Allah Cause He Chose Me
Broke Into The Vattican Strangled The Pope With His Rosary
What, What What What, What, What What What What


Jedi Mind Heavenly Divine
Steadily Shine In '99
What What


Mc's Face Terror Wherever My Sounds Audible
Man From Third World Portal Battle Mortals Who Slaughter U
Seen Inside The Visions Of Beyond
The Dwellings Of Omn
Existent In Islamic Patheon
Flows Got Degrees All My Clothes Got The Scent Of Trees
I Lay Back And Blow Sacks Like Kenny G's
Power Blast Whackin My Path Devoured Fast
I'll Leave With A Grain Of Sand In Lifes Hour Glass
Devise A Spell Make Demons Rise Out Of Hell Grad U By Your Lapelles And Rob U Of Your Outer Shells
Feel The I'll Dire Messire And Hell Fire
Launch Writers Put Your Jaw On A Gauze Wire
Jedi Swordsmen Your Rap Is A Foul Fortune
Besides Well Be Tossin Your Body Into A Coffin
Insane Damage Is Done Your Fuckin With The Army
We Beat The Skulls In The Shape Of A Wet Bag Of Laundry
What, Yea Yea




Yo The Gods Around, The Dramatarzan


Your Fibical Light, Law Of The Titans

Watch Out For Fake Heads Deviled The Skysmen


Arriving From The Dawn And Spawned With I'll Form


Battle Leave You Laying Dead In The womb Like Stillborns


The Master Herein


The Ominous The Master Spirit


Can't Understand The Language Of Rappers With Bile Lyrics


Ikon The Python


Rappers Are Left Strangled


I Overlook The Earth Cause I See It From Sun's Angle


Above The Clouds


We Set High, We Daze
Write A Page
On How You Enslave The Worldly Way


Islamic Marksmen


Seeing The Squad Then...


... Could Be Your Fatal Mistake


Like The First Sins Of Adam In The Garden


You Feel Sorrow
I Projected Is All Apollo


Explore Realms You Left Too Confused To Follow


Invite Your Town To Absorb The Sniper Rounds


Illadelph, Shamballah, Nigga Staying Underground
