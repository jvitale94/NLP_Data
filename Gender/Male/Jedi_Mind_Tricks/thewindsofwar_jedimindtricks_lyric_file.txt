And studied, and followed, forever."


Prepare for the verbal war
The hologram advance, psychical form
Manifesting universal mind into the lore
Travelling lands, I stand on sands of chemical vibration
The math, kings of light departed in wrath
So where you gonna stand when the Elohi returns
Seven great sages throughout the ages say you burn
It's my turn to shine
I redefine the crystalline-biological structures, implanted in your mind
So I find the deaf, dumb and blind
And bless 'em with science, and leave the blind ones behind
Descending into big balls of mass, in the form of rain
The Verbal Hologram brings pain
So rearrange, disagreeable ways that brought you the darkness
Take hold, and rip out your soul from your carcass
And rise away like a sham
The Verbal Hologram is the verbal avalanche
One last chance to re-plan, and over-stand
Before the Hologram sends your camp to Holy Land
So ask your man, when he returns to where I sent him
The plan was to kill God and reinvent Him
Practicing Black Magical tactics like voodoo
Attacking like the seven deadly warships of Nibiru


Give insight to the blind
The dumb are mostly intrigued by the drum (intrigued by the drum)


I bring forth the mighty , the powerful zapatra
The darkening behind you, the biblical omega
The Ashtar Command; I come to bring mortals the barathory gland
So here I stand on the Four Corners of Stonehendge
Travelling through portals, the  of battles, the lord of the immortals
The zeal of the seven, the rising of the demon
The lost books of the Bible and forgotten books of Eden
The heathens, who burn like 
Handed the Holy tablets, like Moses
The blackening of roses, will send you to the edges of the land
The emerald tablets of Thoth The Atlantean
The hands of the mighty Lion of Judah
Will throw you through the triangular portals of Bermuda
Exploring the Hologramic aspects of consciousness
For aliens truth devour, orthodox vs. running through fistic equations for power
The shower of acid rain brings pain to the land
You cannot kill what you cannot see
The Verbal Hologram
