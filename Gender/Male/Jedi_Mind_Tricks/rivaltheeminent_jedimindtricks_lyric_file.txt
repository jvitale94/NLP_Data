I will eighy-six a pussy La Couspaude
I ain't talking to this  if im not gon beef
If i take an L, I take an L and that's on me, you see
I waited all day, mama gravy made
And if the bitch behave herself, I'll take her down to Katie Spade
You disrespect me, I Glock a pussy like Flavor Flav
The Ghost Rider, the coat rider, the 
And you don't want an issue with the kings
Cause motherfuckers walk around with pistols in their jeans
It ain't always as superficial as it seems
Cause we had a little issue that was ripping at the seams
But now we back again on a Stoupe track again
Heavenly divine when I told you about the Vatican
We smoking wakata sippin' on the yak again
Edwin died so we had to get up out the trap again


Time travelin' swords rattle we cry battle
Jackets is full metal we be throwin' em at you
Build you a shrine have your people make you a statue
That's what happens when disaster comes natural 


Either we shoot the guns or we shoot the five
But either way you shootin with Vinnie is choosin suicide
I ain't tryna fuck around with y'all or catch a 2-5
But I ain't gon' let you disrespect me you will lose your lives (you motherfuckers will die)
C'mon why you tryna compete dude?
Break your fuckin' neck now your only option to eat soup
Chop the mafucker up
I don't need a complete loop
Me and stoupe just needed a couple minutes to recupe'
And I ain't got the whole entire fam in yet
There's a bunch of shit that i ain't got my hand in yet
Listen, you can't even walk that shit
You got jewels i will make you come up off that shit stupid
I ain't made haj yet, but imma do it soon
Momma still crack me in the head with a wooden spoon
C'mon dummy why you do that for?
I'm the hack saw, crack y'all 2x4 yeah


Time travelin' swords rattle we cry battle
Jackets is full metal we be throwin' em at you
Build you a shrine have your people make you a statue
Thats what happens when disaster comes natural
