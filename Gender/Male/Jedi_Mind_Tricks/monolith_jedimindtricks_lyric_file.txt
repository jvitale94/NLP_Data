We can go toe to toe and see who's rhyme is greater
I don't think you ever wanna step inside the chamber
I don't think you wanna see inside the eyes of Vader
Couldn't comprehend the force that I bring
I'm like Rocky Marciano when he walk in the ring
A stork in the ring you cowards soundin' soft when you sing
But I'm as angry as a motherfucker caught in the bing
It's awful to bing but I'm a warrior and standin' tall
And I ain't stoppin' like an arab in Isreali war
Ya'll some broke motherfuckers you can barely ball
I'm eatin' my fam eatin' cousin we can share it all
Money the root of all evil I don't care at all
Now me and Jus is back together we ain't scared at all
We 'bout to do it all over like it's 99
The puerto rock, the moreno and the itali-an


These are the last days, black plagues, mass graves
Half the slaves, aids, cascades, black parades
Backpack strapped grenades, brazen acts of rage, accolades
May as well have rang the bell at the gates of hell
That's a Dave Chappelle, you must hate yourselves
Chasin' your tails, wastin', debatin' whales
Read your mail, were tracin' your paper trails
I'm incredible, unforgettable, undetectable impeccable, thee inevitable
Unprofessional, unscheduled rebel, disheveled, unsettled, unleveled
You're the friend of a friend, I'm the beginning and end
Model citizen, you just model the trends, you just follow your friends
While my opposite twin, two sides hydrogen one oxygen


When I'm rhymin' your jaw drops
Making everyone of your thoughts stop
I'm God while ya'll are wrestlin' over pork chops
Devil had ya'll thinkin' we was there when that ball dropped
I ain't gonna front I strapped with the doors locked
Now I walk around this motherfucker with 4's, ock
Big enough to put a fuckin hole in the law, ock
That ain't somethin' that you wanna explore, ock
Unless you want the army come and kick in your door, ock
Unless you wanna end up bloody and wet
Fuck China's government and what they done to Tibet
We from Philly where the sun doesn't set
Where the motherfuckers rob you with a gun to your neck
Where you shook motherfuckers wouldn't come to the vet
Where your Jordan's gettin' vicced when you come on the set
Where corrupt cops plant a fuckin' gun in your vest
Where we retaliate by puttin' fuckin' one in they chest
