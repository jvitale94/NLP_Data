I'm getting it, you already know it
You know I'm tryina fuck, it's 4 in the morning
If you're not then don't pick up, bitch it's 4 in the morning

I'm in my Rolls, just met up with Rose
Loubretton toes, with the earring in the nose
She wanna be a model type, shorty strike a pose
Fine, with some brains on 'er, shorty strike a blow
She think she ready for the fast life
I'm gonna show er what that fast like
I must have been a motherfucker in my past life
Cause I just fucked me 2 more mamasitas last night
I did, I must admit it, I did it
That hustle mode, I'm in it
That pussy game I be winnin
Got black mixed with Caucasian
Hispanic man or Asian
I spend the night watching a cat fight
And in the morning we all blazing

Got the money coming, that bitch is gone
I'm getting it, you already know it
You know I'm tryina fuck, it's 4 in the morning
If you're not then don't pick up, bitch it's 4 in the morning

Champagne on ice, bad bitches all fine
Heard that all her friends wanna go, alright
They hit that crib and go for rollin up, all night
It's me versus them and the bitches love me long time

Pretty tittie shorty, what you need a bra for?
Be naked when I pull up, what you think I called for?
She got 3 partners with er, man I'm fuckin all 4
Little ma ride the pole like a Volvo
Yea, you hear the call of the midnight
I'm tryina see just what it is like
I won't be long, shorty sit tight
Whippin in my Lamborghini, hundred through the red light'
I'm dangerous, sorry little mama that it came to this
Put a boot to the pussy and 'm aiming for this
I really really should make her pay for this
That good dick shorty, had a gang of this
What you're getting from your nigga ain't the same as this
You know goddamn well when I came for this
The Rose and the Molly get the blame for this

Got the money coming, that bitch is gone
I'm getting it, you already know it
You know I'm tryina fuck, it's 4 in the morning
If you're not then don't pick up, bitch it's 4 in the morning

Champagne on ice, bad bitches all fine
Heard that all her friends wanna go, alright
They hit that crib and go for rollin up, all night
It's me versus them and the bitches love me long time
