(Common man stop playing)


Girl are you available
Is you taken
Do you got a man or not
I know a place we can go
Getting naked
I think about getting hot
So shortay what you sipping on
Tell me
You ain't got no panties on
With me
Your the only one I wanna take home
With me
Girl are you available


Now here we go again
Back in the club making it hot
We buy the  we ain't taking no shots
When it comes to bad chicks
I should have her ass fixed
Next to my name
An ma games dat sick
Who's dis, who's dis
It's N-E double L-Y
I'm a billionaire boy
Babi you can tell why
I be in the G4, better yet the G5
From the  to Brazil
All the way to N-Y
Oh my, I'm high as a cloud
