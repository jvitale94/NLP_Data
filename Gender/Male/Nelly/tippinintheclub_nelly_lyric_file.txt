I'm rich bitch got damn right
Hunned thousand on my left hunned mo on my right
I'm business I know what you like
I know how you want it I gave it to you more than twice
30 mil and countin'
The money wired and routed
If you compare our accountants
Comparin' hills to mountains
I got twenty inch mounted
On somethin' blue like an avatar
Got clown whips safe to say I got silly cars
Got silly broads
Movie stars bent over mini bars
Now all my Niki broads wanna' have a minaj
And I'm like oh shitta
You betta come get her
Before I Bruce Jenner
Run dick up in her

I'm rich bitch got damn right
10 carats on my left
10 mo' on my right
I'm business I know what she like
That's why she grinnin' cause she know when I'm right
She like way I give orders she like the way I deliver
She like the way I bust her bust her

But I never raw dig her
Cause I'm a 9 figure
A swoop in the coupe nigga
A view of the whole Lou'
From the pool on the roof nigga
You don't want it with yo
Shawty say she ain't never
But she want it with me yo
Oh shitta you betta come get her
Before I Bruce Jenner run dick
Up in her
