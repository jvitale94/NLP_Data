What's popping?
(I can tell the way you move that body, now)
Nelly, you sing it...
All my niggas say "ooh..."
(A whole lot of that, they know not a bitch that can copy that)
All my niggas say "ooh..."
(Take it all off and do that, now take it all off)
Take it all off... take it all off... (yeah)


Now tell me where you wanna be now
I know you wanna be here
But I don't see it in your body language, baby
I just wanna be clear
See, I've been spending time on that other shit
I ain't tryna get lost
But the way you're moving that on me, girl
Tell me, what does that cost?
I love that real shit that feel good
Good head that feel good
I'm a be all off in that womb
And I'm hopin' to God that you feel good
I'm a go fast or slow, on the bed or floor
Mama, I just wanna take you (away...)
Long hair, you don't care
Lovin' the fact that you all in my (space...)
The way you lookin' at me, that's gon' get you that
Ooh... and I put everything on it
Keep talkin' that shit that'll get you that


Girl, I swear the way you move your body
Put that on my mama, you gon' get that
And you know I've seen a whole lot of shit
Ain't no bitch out here can copy that (a whole lot of that)
(They know no bitch can copy that - go and take it all off)
And you done fucked a few of my niggas
But I find myself still wanting that
Hey... something's wrong with my mind
I apologize for my thoughts...
I've been thinkin' 'bout that...
Let me make you say "ooh..."
(A whole lot of that, they know not a bitch that can copy that)
(Take it all off and do that, you gotta take it all off)
Take it all off... take it all off...


(A whole lot of that, they know not a bitch that can copy that)
(Take it all off and do that, you gotta take it all off)
Take it all off... take it all off...
I apologize for my thoughts, don't worry 'bout my ex
She was giving me fights while you was givin' me sex
I'll throw you up on that sink, run that fountain over them cheeks
Bend you over that tub, got you hot here wildin' out on me
You act like a lady, you fuck like a freak
Forever my lady, you'll be a freak for me
I'm pulling all on your hair while you got your toes curling
Your eyes rolling back in your head...
That good sex got you so wet you got an ocean all in my bed
What you lookin' at? That's gon' get you that
Ooh... and I'll put everything on it
That skirt right there gon' get you that


Girl, I swear the way you move your body
Put that on my mama, you gon' get that
And you know I've seen a whole lot of shit
Ain't no bitch out here can copy that (a whole lot of that)
(They know no bitch can copy that - go and take it all off)
And you done fucked a few of my niggas
But I find myself still wanting that
Hey... something's wrong with my mind
I apologize for my thoughts...
I've been thinkin' 'bout that...
Let me make you say "ooh..."
