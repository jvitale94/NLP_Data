


Sweetness flowing like a faucet, body bangin' no corset
Brother's wanna toss it but they lost cause my game ain't no forfeit
Slicker than a porpoise and thicker than a horse's
Carmen Brown got the whole town speechless
I stick to my thesis, I stick to my features
Brother's try to hold but they game never reaches
And most of these cats are like the middle of peaches
I see you lookin' at but what you lookin' at
You want a bomb, wanna twist me like a bottle cap


I'm tryin' to holler miss to see if you gon' holler back


Your game is wack and no you will not get your quarter back
See this is Carmen, curves like a quota sack
Skin coffee and cream, your donuts, you ain't dunkin' that


But this is Milla, Lieutenant if you're wonderin'


And I'm Natheniel, (Mos Def) Mel Gibson (Sam) Danny Gloverin'


I knew not he you might as well be mumblin'
See I have dreams of the man what would become of him
There's not a kid out here who can make me believe
I should postpone my goals, he got tricks up his sleeve
Whole bar full of cups and you ain't lockin' me down


I got a warrant for ya heart and bear for the trial


Get a pardon if ya come with the sargeant now


Give me a chair cause I don't care I ain't feelin' your style


Yo, I'm tryin' to get with you shorty
(But I'm not feelin' you)
But I'm an officer shorty
(My looks are killin' you)
Murder one will get you under the covers
(Game talk or manslaughter I ain't feelin' you brothers)


Eyes like the ocean


Ma I got some lotion
Hold ya thighs, raise em' high and daddy long stroke em'


Hair like forever


I swear I could do it better
Take the gun out my holster, I still rock a beretta


You brothers sweat Carmen like Patrick Ewing
But that kid


Don't waste ya time he ain't worth doin'
He just a sargeant, passin' out tickets for parking


Chickenheads cluckin'


Pitiful fools barkin'
See this is Carmen, voice sweet as Marvin
I turn out lights with the switch when I'm walkin'
Girls steady jealous cause they man always hawkin'
Even got Lou lookin' at me like he stalkin'
And I got a mind too, wouldn't bless you
If your first name was Ha-Choo, on Sunday singin' gospel


You ain't a dime just a nickel actin' high school


Headed for the big top and bouncin' on this side show
