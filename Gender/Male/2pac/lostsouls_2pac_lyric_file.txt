My life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin' one time
(Lost soul)
How it start, how it start

Started off with runnin' from cops duck and hide from helicopters
We open fire, who can stop us
Livin' the life of trife juveniles, hopin' for Rikers
Gettin' twenty-five to life, if the judge don't like us

In my clearest pictures, I see authorities itchin' to get us
ATF state feds scandalous bitches
I wasn't promised to it, wasn't bitter or sweet
See if a, nigga don't hustle then a nigga don't eat

Only streets livin' do or die circle complete
Repetitive motions and felons in the rush for cheese
Please understand my history a man of many acts
Live a thug life, comin' equipped, with many gats

Maybe I was just a lost soul, trapped in time
Livin' in between life and the cracks were blind
Even though we had hopes for dreams that never came
Yet still we all feel pain

Just wait until the rain turn to sunshine
'Cause I hate to spend my life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin' one time, stranded in the county in the worst way
Hell of a way to spend my twenty-first birthday

Born in the ghetto as a street thug
It's for the neighborhood and weed spots that we love
Lost souls, lost souls, nigga for my homeboys that passed on
Words from the mind of a lost soul

Just wait until the rain turn to sunshine
'Cause I hate to spend my life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin' one time

My brother Sean, first on my list, he stuck with
A three-five when he get out would I be dead or alive
He taught me the rules so much, but still in thugs I trust
When in danger never hesitate to keep my fuckin' trap shut

My mom dukes got a little bit of thug in her
The devil loves sinners crackheads and drug dealer
Sometimes I feel like the streets are takin' over
Never stayin' sober, the brain over and over backtrack

My stack's fat, I used to take down new
One love to my crew aiyyo this one's for you
R.I.P., rest in peace to Moo Brown
Know what we gotta do, baby one time

Just wait until the rain turn to sunshine
'Cause I hate to spend my life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin' one time
Just wait until the rain turn to sunshine
'Cause I hate to spend my life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin' one time
One time, one time, one time

I was born twenty-two years ago, yesterday
But see I saw no reason for me to celebrate, let me demonstrate
Entered the world from out a poisonous womb
Heroin bein' consumed already predicitin' my doom, soon

To be one of the many misguided
Always the first one on the block to be done tried it and liked it
Lost before I had a chance to find my way
Now I travel through life, not knowin' the time of day

Crime for pay, I'm on my way but don't know, where I'm a end up
I swear to God, this is a setup
And these are the words from the mind of a lost soul
(I'm a lost soul)

Just wait until the rain turn to sunshine
'Cause I hate to spend my life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin' one time
Just wait until the rain turn to sunshine
'Cause I hate to spend my life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin' one time

Just wait until the rain turn to sunshine
'Cause I hate to spend my life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin' one time
Just wait until the rain turn to sunshine
'Cause I hate to spend my life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin' one time

Just wait until the rain turn to sunshine
'Cause I hate to spend my life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin' one time
Just wait until the rain turn to sunshine
'Cause I hate to spend my life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin' one time

Just wait until the rain turn to sunshine
'Cause I hate to spend my life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin' one time
Just wait until the rain turn to sunshine
'Cause I hate to spend my life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin' one time

All of y'all, keepin' y'all in hell
To all of y'all, keepin' y'all in hell
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
To all of y'all, keepin' y'all in hell
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself

For all my Doggz, keepin y'all in hell
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
For all my Doggz, keepin y'all in hell
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
For all my Doggz, keepin y'all in hell
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself

Throw your hands up
Throw your hands up
Throw your hands up
Throw your hands up
