Party people in the place
Embrace the bass as I commence to pick up the pace
And make you motivate, and accelerate
Cause like Tony the Tiger, Iâ€™m greeeat!
Always seem to come off, hard for you somehow
I mean me being wack, oh come come now
Thatâ€™s quite ridiculous, so just admit you was
Thrilled, itâ€™s on your face, and itâ€™s conspicuous
Not that youâ€™re on this, but my performance
Is rather exquisite, so hard is it
Or supremacy, thatâ€™s the perfect definition
But rappers keep wishing to be in my position
Know good and damn well they ainâ€™t no competition
Huh, I gotta give it to you kid, thatâ€™s ambition
For you to perpetrate the role of me, the Big Daddy
The Big Father, naah, donâ€™t even bother
Cause that would mean you would have to teach
Each and every one idiotic son
Trying to make it, you canâ€™t fake it
The rhymes I recite are fully dressed and yours are butt naked
Your speech is weak, while my mine stands strong
So, all hail the man thatâ€™s here to live long

You know you heard this voice before somewhere
And when I said that Iâ€™m the Kane, you said â€œoh yeah!â€
That brother that used to rhyme on stage with Biz
Oh heâ€™s def,â€ you know what time it is
But this time Iâ€™m not assisted on the microphone
More like Patti Labelle, on my own
Just single-handed, the mic I commanded
Phony MCâ€™s donâ€™t understand it, and it
Is the real thing like the taste of Coke
So never sleep on me, better stay awoke
Like a gambler in Vegas, I go for broke
To make a long story short, yo I ainâ€™t no joke
I take time and care in whatever Iâ€™m doing
And when I rock a party, I make sure that you en-
Joy what youâ€™re hearing as I entertain
So hip hip hoolay, long live the Kane

I got the freedom of speech to use it anyway that I choose it
So all hail to the music
On exhibit, get with it, now hereâ€™s my ring
The original supreme being Black man
Point blank, the cream to rise supreme
As those go below like a submarine
Reaching and teaching a lesson that Iâ€™m giving
Addressing and impressing the crowd, so how we living?
Fine in mind, to decline is out of line
So pardon this brother as I give you mine
To say Iâ€™m not, donâ€™t even diss yourself
Cause at times, I have to jump back and kiss myself
Long live the K, the A, the N, the E
I say the end will be
A big movement, by the time Iâ€™m through
And thatâ€™s coming from a Black manâ€™s point of view

Now pardon me for just changing the issue
But all you sucker MCâ€™s, itâ€™s a must that I diss you
The way yâ€™all be fronting has made me disgusted
Now Iâ€™mma set you straight, so so yo yo, bust it
Rappers try and hang and just swear that they can party
But the style that Iâ€™m using is just like karate
So if we ever battle youâ€™re bound to be through
Because I got a black belt in Rap Can Do
No Iâ€™m not Chinese, itâ€™s just rhymes like these
That destroy an MC with black belt degrees
Youâ€™re rocking a party, trying so hard to get loose
Kid sound awiiite, but I canâ€™t taste the juice
Therefore, the job is left to me
So I get the party kicking just like Bruce Lee
But I wonâ€™t stop there, I still rock a little harder
While the toy MCâ€™s step and say, Sayonara!

Long Live the Kane! (x2)
Break it down!
