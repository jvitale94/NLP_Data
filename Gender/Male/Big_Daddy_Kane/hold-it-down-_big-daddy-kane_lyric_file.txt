Big Daddy Kane
Veteranz Day
Hold It Down
Rappers stepped to me, but they didn't get none
I'm the kane so you know the outcome
The microphone crooner, should have set the tone sooner
Hip hop to me re boxing to roy jones jr.
The genuine, search and you'll find
That on the microphone i can handle mine
Here's a view to a kill as i flipped the skill
When it's time to rock the mic like al scratch i get ill
I come equipped to fight and if i flip tonight
Effects on mc's are similar to kryptonite
Water flows that be hard to distinguish
It's best to relinquish, you don't want the god to bring this
I'm marvelous at the art of this, even if you got assist
Stepping to me is a lot of risk. i release skills that's abundant
To explode and drop on you like flight 800

Chorus
Keep it moving world renown
Showing and proving
That we can hold it down

Verse 2
Here's a percentage of that old vintage
Macaroni flow but its mare than an image
Don't let the smooth taste fool ya , let me school ya
On what it is, straight up square biz
Swift maneuvering to crush the crew you bring
Last thing them want tell me is kane go do your thing who the king
Asiatic non equivalent to any
Plus i play the game a more harder way than penny
The plan that i mobilize for dough to rise is no surprise
That it comes from what i vocalize
I'm the best you can get as i hit you with
The stroke of death and i ain't even broke a sweat
But this is where i draw the. line you're sure to find
Lyrics i be dropping is too much for the mortal mind
What's being caused is many mc's i'm seeing lost
The hip hop laws should be reinforced
You made a record this year, oh you're hot
Something fishy about your style, who flow you got
You thought that you could hold me down no you're not
Now back up off me, here i come to blow the spot

Chorus

Verse 3
Alright, here i come to get some
But instead you don't want the love to spread
I heard that jealousy and envy is a dum one's tool
So daddy says nothing he keeps his cool
I been through your tribulations and conflicts
Anything possible to keep me out the mix
But ease back, boy you better freeze that
Where my rivalries lack i'm still nice with these black
I rap with the safety cap so that you don't get it twisted
And be another statistic
How many more to try, is sure to die
Slaughter i, all that playa hating only makes me fortify
To get the papers to me is a necessity
And i don't want a piece of the pie i want the recipe
I can't lose with what i use
I'm the reason why the lady sings the blues
Don't get it confused

Chorus
