They wanna know how nigga do it, youknawhati'masayin
I had a nigga come up to me and ask me and shit
Why I ain't got that, youknawhati'msayin
Fuck nigga get on your job, nigga let your nuts hang beeitch
Check it out though


These well, theeeeeese
41st side Lake Entertainment
Oh yea, if you come to QB you gonna get...


Yo, foes decompose in their coffins, hoes creepin with bosses
No sleep in my fortress break day thinkin of losses
Taxes and IRS government gangstas
But I'm a scientist in love with big president faces
My residence changes from ghetto to acres
Avoidin jealousy snake shit
Can't afford another felony lake bent drivin them Porsche
Niggaz sayin Nas came through Wit a flyin saucers 
With some strange shoes on the tirin flossin
So now they know wanna offer 'em killin stick 'em and cost 'em
Catch him slippin, trippin get 'em for all his fortune
Sup with this Nas hatred, y'all can suck my dick
Got these niggaz wives naked makin them fuck my fist
My mystique have the world froze
My physique got me dressed up in shell toes
In ganga leaf, I inhale slow
I'm from out of town capsule some kind of portal
Spittin these rhyme at you like a martyr


Lay low, lay low (lay low)
Cuz all y'all niggaz won't (y'all niggaz)
If you come to QB you goin to get murdered 
You goin to get murdered (murdered, murdered)
You going to get murdered (Why get shot up)
If you come to QB you goin to get murdered


Sayin old dudes jewel me, now salute me
I've grew more than they ever though I would be
Havin no pops to mourn me, just show me
God didn't plan for another man to control me
You know me from bustin my gun blood
Even up in north my cell smell like Christian Dior
Before I lost my case I had to gain mastered
Been had heart now my papers startin to match it
I stack til they capture me and kept a bottle of half-a-G
And sold 20's while I rap to beast
My wifey beef over my robberies
But they put my man in the "L" still on the armory
Loyal to the heritage, though I put 7 in it
Dudes snaked me, word to Spanky, I never snitch
I put a bullet in your face 'fore I go to Jake
Rule number 1 out here, don't fuck with Lake


Lay low, lay low (lay low)
Cuz all y'all niggaz won't (y'all niggaz)
If you come to QB your goin to get murdered
Your goin to get chopped up, (murdered) boxed up 
Your goin to get murdered 
If you come to QB your goin to get...


Yo, yo, yo 
Our guns are haunted with the ghost of body
Smoke 'em like we suppose to
Your whole crew come to face to face with shotty
Told you!, Bravehearted we appear when it's on
Light up your block like its day time y'all niggaz be gone
So many niggaz that's be pursuin Nas when they spot me
They be jumpin out of movin cars and landin on my Tims
I tell 'em be careful don't damage the skin
Amateurs cram around wit the hopes to get glance at the end


Aiyo most of my friends have ulterior motives
I'm wise cuz I realize that sounds is golden
Mourned shorty from cat shacky who wrote to me
Livin through them back then was givin hope to me
I control many, being a flossiest
Most notorious, Queensbridge extortionist
Love my hood no question, I'm gonna rep it
But I'm not just a QB tenant, I'm the president
