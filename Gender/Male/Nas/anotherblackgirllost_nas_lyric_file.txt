I’m happy but this shit’s the saddest
I’m maintaining still keeping my status
Fuck what you haters say, my ass is still the fattest
Roll with the baddest, my girl and Gucci glasses
How could you pass this? Your loss
But I ain't trippin’, I’m still a boss
I won’t be another black girl lost
Lost, lost, lost, lost, Lost, lost
I won’t be another black girl lost


Brown and beautiful, black and stunning, light and delicious
Chocolate covered, strawberry kisses and cherry lipstick
Very mystic, bald stitches her wig
Kinky, curly or dread
Goddess come grant my wishes
Tantalising touch of succulent skin, we should wed
Start off broke then stay together till we make it big
My Queen is English so join the truth I can learn from you
Never Ike Turner you but look what you tryna do like
Get out of order you’re not a supporter of my dream
Rich girl fantasy schemes, a good man she needs
But she young and she speeding honey, now whats the reason
You just met this nigga think you owe him a fucking threesome
So you lusting to have a baby by a Denver Nugget
You don’t love him you want security, baby you’re buggin’
Financial liberty you’re after, it’s how you live
But the blood test shows, it’s not even his kid


I’m pregnant, don’t know who the dad is
I’m happy but this shit’s the saddest
I’m maintaining still keeping my status
Fuck what you haters say my ass is still the fattest
Roll with the baddest, my girl and Gucci glasses
How could you pass this? Your loss
But I ain't trippin’, I’m still a boss
I won’t be another black girl lost

Ya lost (lost)
Ya lost (lost)
She lost (lost)
Black girl lost (lost)
I said she lost (lost)
Ya loss (lost)
I love ya
(I won’t be another black girl lost)


Chanel bags, everything
She shopping every time she gets a wedding ring
This her third marriage, 4 carats
Brand new Jag, deserves to have it
Temptation, she can’t let go her dirty habits
Mid 30′s, spendin’ dough at Magic
She’s dancin’, romancin’, she’s up at Manson
She fucks all my mans, and they pop the Magnum
So now what you gonna do, the morning after pill is way overdue
‘posed to get married, now you embarrassed
Who does this kid belong to?
Promiscuous, cause you got touched by step-dads, sex at
Such a young age, you’s a virgin, I get mad
Sick society, blaming yourself so wrong
I highly respect you, bet that, strong, intelligent
This song ain’t to poke fun of you, to get laughs
I just love you, really love you
Here for you, wanna trust you
Wanna cuff you, be my lady
But first, I gotta see the baby
