Hey hey hey hey
And I tell them fuck you, if you hatin
So fuck you, we makin money bitch
That's really all I gotta say
Im'ma just start rapping and SHUT THE FUCK UP
Bloaw


I said they actin like they better but they ain't ever been the shit
Hows it feel to have a hundred thousand people on ya dick?
Well, it feels good, homie you should probably try it
If you never rocked a sold out show then keep quiet
I gets busy on a track, workin double time
Tryna find a foreign pussy just to put my tongue inside
I be on top of the charts, your just an underline
Tearin through the streets all these haters n suckers run inside
Furious, fool probably wanna come and stomp me out
Mad they got a girl, and I'm all that bitch talks about
Be gettin money since I walked around my fathers house
That dads be cop and search when I come and take their daughters out
Paper comes in large amounts, I'm eatin like i should
Surf n terf shit sink my teeth in something good
They mad I ain't hood
Naww I came to party hard
Your grillin at me but I smile back, bitch party hard


Cmon down, grab your girlfriend down, make her spin around
Ain't no other motherfucker get the people this well
What you want? some futuristic funk
Tell me what you want, a lil futuristic funk
We those kids gettin cheese on some cheetos shit
Just fuckin for the night then we leave that bitch
So what you want? some futuristic funk
Tell me what you want, a lil futuristic funk


Hey hey
So you probably heard I rap a ton, havin fun
Never have I had a gun
Vomit when I spit like I devoured something bad for lunch
Tryna firgure out the way to get me rich, I have a hunch
Like velma up or scoobydoo, confusing like a rubix cube
Usually dont do this I be stupid just a nuisance
All you seem to hear about I'm in ya ear: q-tip
Yeah that's dude sick, sleeve with a few tricks
Breath in a huge splif, weed come in two zips
You like it when i burn it like a furnace
When the erb hits
Like it cuz I only smokin good baby turnips
Bitch I'm fallin from the sky like bird shit
Makin movies everywhere I go, call me Ernest


Cmon down, grab your girlfriend down, make her spin around
Ain't no other motherfucker get the people this well
What you want? some futuristic funk
Tell me what you want, a lil futuristic funk
We those kids gettin cheese on some cheetos shit
Just fuckin for the night then we leave that bitch
So what you want? some futuristic funk
Tell me what you want, a lil futuristic funk

Like Uh, like uhhh.
