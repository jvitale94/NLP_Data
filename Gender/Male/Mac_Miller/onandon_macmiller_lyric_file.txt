Hey
Excuse me son, can I see your identification?

I wanna walk into the mall, tell the man ill take it all 
Drop in from the rooftop, what's gon' break my fall 
I think I might go on and on forever

Travel round the world to places I ain't been before 
I think I might go on and on forever
I think this could go on and on forever

I wanna walk into the store, I'll take everything and more
Travel round the world to places I ain't been before 
I think I might go on and on forever
I think this could go on and on forever
