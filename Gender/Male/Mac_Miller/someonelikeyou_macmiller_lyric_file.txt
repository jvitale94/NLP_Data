Light up till the pain gone
All I hear is this same song when the radio came on
Fuck around and get based on
Do this shit till the day I die
Are you ready? Are you ready?
Terrified but my hand is steady
Verified get the camera ready
Carry my own weight all these earthquakes don't wake
Me up from this deep sleep diving into this cold lake
Fuck a bitch 'til her toes shake telling me I'm her soul mate
Disguised emotion no face bull shit with that no thanks
Dealing with her since 08 fucked around I'm done
I heard you're supposed to race when you hear the sound of that gun
Now it's losing all of it's fun spending days in solitude
Too many dumb interviews put me in this awful mood
Not thinking logical, getting high jump off the moon
Looked into his soul when he died right there in the hospital
Peace don't seem possible when the mind is so closed
Came in for your money then left with all of your hoes


Life moves fast but my baby keep it slow
Open up your mind start forgetting what you know (Oh!)
This shit ain't been the same since you left me here alone (Whoa!)
You hurt so good
Girl your love, it hurts so good


Uh love me love me that Fentanyl it numb me
Beautiful to get ugly turn you into a junkie
Still searching for something but I don't know what
Dreaming about nothing wake you up and then fuck
I love it when you get a little nasty
Hit it from the back if you like that wiggle them ass cheeks
Isn't that sweet same shit we did last week
For all the cash you might of stood up and would've walked past me
Wake me up from this bad dream put a match to this gasoline
Every night you somebody different got me thinking it's Halloween
Fucked up can't feel myself work hard might kill myself
Exist through audio where all my problems they're real as hell
Trapped in this wishing well, death creeping like Splinter Cell
Getting high put my mind away find the words I'm tryna say
Imma think of that later when the world goes against you
You better get that paper


Life moves fast but my baby keep it slow
Open up your mind start forgetting what you know (Oh!)
This shit ain't been the same since you left me here alone (Whoa!)
You hurt so good
Girl your love, it hurts so good
