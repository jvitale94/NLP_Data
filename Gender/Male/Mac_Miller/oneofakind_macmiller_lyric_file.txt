I ain't nothing like you so what is going on? It must be something wrong you'll love me when I'm gone. I'm going keep on doing me, cause you don't' matter and you just an actor and I ain't just a rapper. Noooo... (I'm One Of A Kind )


Here's a prototype that I know you like (right) headed to the light on over night flight never in your life you going see another me I tend catch the eye like a pair of " double d's " I'm near not the same, a pioneer. Stabbed the game in the heart with a giant spree trying to see success god damn it's clear the time shine like a chandelier I'm going threw this case. Spitting about what to relate too never could you duplicate any of the music made getting super paid looking at our future store recognizing me when I past them in a moving car, always worried about finding out who you are you know somebody you got look into his heart yo mind so blind I'm ahead of my time (I'm One Of A Kind )




My pops said young man you ain't ready for the world ahead way too much marijuana always have girls in the bed; you going realize life ain't a party fuck around you going end up starvin, fuck I stay fly live free die hard no Bruce Willis this the whole nine yard thought that I can rhyme bars go and buy cars you gotta grind hard one the sun rise start and my heart great things in my future cause broke rappers (shit) that's just a rumor, I see the diamond chain, mansion in the videos they must got silly dough, do they really? or is it all just a scheme for your eyes (for your eyes) pr are you in disguise god damn I can't decided all the words here come from a mind got nothing to hide boy. I'm One Of A Kind.


Walking through this world I just take a look around (around) ain't nobody here like me don't nobody got my style people say I'm different I sure you that's okay (that's okay) Cause I'm way past tomorrow and you stuck in today!
