

You know it's been a minute since I been awake
Didn't mean to cause you pain, I just needed to escape
They saying that I'm sober, I'm just in a better place
I'm on my way over, I'm just running kind of late
And you know I've been through all the highs
I've seen all the lows
Lost track of time, I'm coming home
You know my mind, the place it goes
When it goes, when it goes
It's only a game
Don't be afraid
These doors will close
And people change
One day you'll go
Right now you're here
No please just hear
Don't disappear
