If you tryna feel the vibe throw your hands up in the sky
Motherfucker get em up up up up up up
Get em up up up up up up 


The wheels stay spinnin on the civic boy I'm always on the move
When you grindin all the time there's alot of shit to do
That's why I got Q cus he keeps me on the routine
I be 2 ski tryna kick it like Bruce Lee
Clean shoes boy new feet, and I'm never in the car with only 2 seats
I got a whip full of people all fresh call em 10 deep... motherfuckers we the future like next week.
Young people don't see you as an equal they just see you at the  tryna send you back to preschool
You only gettin one shot no redo,
Tell them haters keep they mouth shut, eat glue,
Bitch, who the fuck you playin with,
I'm Justin Bieber meet Jadakiss,
Here to take what  treat em all like Taylor Swift,
Leave em in a daze all like what day is it
Yeah the boy got class no camberidge,
Fresher than your man girl but whiter than a plate of grits
They keep wantin more I'm they favorite dish,
It's me motherfuckers I ain't changin shit


If you in the ride turn the volume real high,
If you tryna feel the vibe throw your hands up in the sky
Motherfucker get em up up up up up up
Get em up up up up up up 


Hey, I gotta brand new phone rockin brand new clothes,
Leavin every single party with a brand new ho,
Yea I've done a little travin circlin the globe
Always keep it movin  showin these hos,
Boy I'm a asshole girls call him a douchebag,
This some old school shit but no boombah,
This ain't new swag... it's the same ol me,
The youngin get respect from the games OGs,
The cameras flashin when we passin so we stay low key,
Go to Mexico to party where the pesos be,
On a turnpike bitch and your tank on E,
With my head out the window screamin Get Like Me,
Ho, you should know the way I roll,
Take a couple shots and superman these hos,
Yoo, ain't nothin with ya wack rap,
Used to be the class clown now I get the last laugh


If you in the ride turn the volume real high,
If you tryna feel the vibe throw your hands up in the sky
Motherfucker get em up up up up up up
Get em up up up up up up
