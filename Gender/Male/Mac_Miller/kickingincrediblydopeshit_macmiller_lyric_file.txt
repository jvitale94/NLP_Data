When you find something that you care about
That's all you got, When you go to sleep at night you dreams of music
When you wake up, this is the same thing.It's right there on your face, You can't skip it. Sometime when you're young, The only place to go is inside
Music, Is what I loved, Take that away from me and I really got nothing
