Give you some compliments you cute
And introduce myself, ya let me in just for a minute 


Yeah, Let me holla at you what your name girl?
Let me walk with you and let me show you some things girl
And I know that your probably thinking that it's game girl
But on the real, see I been looking for a main girl
So can I have a minute, that's only if you with it
We can exchange names and then digits then
Arrange visits or just meet up to kick it
But, I'm on your clock my sixty second is tickin
Yeah, you a cutie though, see I'm just trying to compliment you
Fly ground, fly too, think I would compliment you
One glance then I knew for sure I gotta get you
Put my name in her phone and said I'm glad I met you
See she a gemini, word we the same sign
And we from the same spot throw up the same sign
We both work plus school we on the same grind
Feel like a match, she the one I wanna make mine

See, now I ain't bein fast
I just wanna talk with you
No pressure, Let me walk around the block with you
Trying to think the kind of future we could walk into
And make you see all of the types of things I could offer you
A lifestyle that includes the things that a baller do
Put you in the wifey spot I do it all for you
And start to do all these things that I don't often do
You see I hold my future wifey so I'm broken too
And as some time pass, I prove that id be right for you
And I ain't gamin, leaving, no plays or audibles
Do what I oughta do but momma won't approve
Cause she heard I be in the streets
Like j-walkers do
Just stop and think ma
Don't miss an opportunity
(I mean for real though)
Just listen what you do to me
And everything you do ma, you do it beautifully
Call me selfish cause all I want is you with me
(Cause all I want is you with me)
