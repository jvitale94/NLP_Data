But I'm up to nothing
But my god never leave I'm running
And I don't know where, oh where I'm going to


Uh, and I remember back when
I was just a lost scrawny ass kid that was him
Probably circa '99 6th grade I was in
Found big booty nikki when I met her I was 10
And maybe she might of been a little hoeish
But I walked around with her acting like I didn't know it
Cause she had boobs, and shiny lip gloss
And I heard she was the one if you want your tip boss
So P.E when everybody went to swim
We were making out inside the locker room in the gym
She pulled my trunks down the grabbed a hold of him
It was fucking rad till my fucking teacher walked in


You, you were more then nothing
But I-I I'm less then something
My heart starts to race I'm running
And I just can't wait for you to stay with me

My god you were up to something
But I'm up to nothing
But my god never leave I'm running
And I don't know where, oh where I'm going to


Uh, And I remember back when I was 13 years still trying to get it in
Told my moms one night I'd spend the night at a friends
Then I went to see Lexi
Lexi played the violin
I heard she was a square
But she might give it up
I just bought some tree
Just thought I might twist it up
She was down for it all
She said where do you wanna go
I said back to my crib
She said is anyone home?
I said moms, but I think she fell asleep around 10
So we snuck back hoping she didn't hear us walk in
She gave it up fast
Now I'm thinking epic win
It was fucking rad till my fucking moms walked in


You, you were more then nothing
But I-I I'm less then something
My heart starts to race I'm running
And I just can't wait for you to stay with me

My god you were up to something
But I'm up to nothing
But my god never leave I'm running
And I don't know where, oh where I'm going to
