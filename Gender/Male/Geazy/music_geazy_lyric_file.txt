And all I got is paper on this pad
So hope for a chance
Grinding trying to get my goals accomplished because nothing in this world is ever promised


All I want to do is make music all day


All I want to do is make music


See I was Sixteen, three hundred and sixty three days old, when this story that that I'm about to tell unfolds
A hard headed youngin' thugging just a little bit, robbing people for the guap hitting licks and stealing shit
Yea we was wild when this son was into gun play but I knew karma would catch up with us one day
So when I would rob, man I'm going bankrupt ran up on them hit em, grabbed his wallet and then we ran off,
ran off a few blocks before I lose steam wishing I didn't quit the hoop team because then I would be able to run without running out of breath we ran three blocks then we turned and make a left,
said "Chill bruh we good" till my heart skipped a beat and that's when I looked and seen police rolling down the street,
tried to run but they got us I knew it was a wrap after that sitting in the cop car hands cuffed behind my back knew I wasn't coming back for a minute that meant I wouldn't kick it but above it all that rap shit was finished at least for a minute but to take up time I would sit inside my cell chill and make up rhymes banging beats on the wall and I battled some cats, they like, "damn bruhs white but he go at it with raps" but couldn't wait to come home because for the first time I knew what exactly I wanted to do


Because Hip Hop is all I have through the good and through the bad
And all I got is paper on this pad
So hope for a chance
