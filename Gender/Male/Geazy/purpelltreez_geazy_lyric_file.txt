I'm peace out once my space ship leaves when I light up these purple trees
Are you coming along with me doe before I light up the purple dro
And to the moon blast off let's go as I light up the purple dro


Excuse me may I have your attention?
Allow me to put my two cents in
I have something important to mention
Yo it's 4: 19 on the clock bro and that's when
We smoke out somebody grab a swisher spliff
That thang open get the weed broke out
And get it all in every bit I ain't wastin shit
You see this here we got is a relationship

When I was thirteen I fell hard for you
You don't wanna talk need to hit it hard for you
You're so attractive the aroma you carry
Got some chicks on the side but I'm in love with you mary
And when we hook up you relieve that stress
You know what's up when I come round
Uhh I'm bout to put you in this tight brown dress
And me and you are bout to get DOWN




Hold on I'm just buzzin
Breakin on the dutch about to roll me another l'
Mary and her mother, grandaddy and cousin
No trees go undiscovered I'm marijuana's colombus
Floatin to a new world feelin' like I'm dumber but
I'm high school high I took courses in the summer
I'm torchin' when the sun up, I'm blazin when the sun down
Just know I stay built every time you see me come 'round
Damn I be lit like a halogen
I spark it and I let it burn slow I ain't a fire-man
Eyes low, shawty ask me where the bottle went
But I don't drink shit I'm on budwisin' and 
Yeaah so you know I'm on
It might take a week for me to fall out my zone
Yeah I blow to every 
And when the box run out I'm blowing out my bones




The homie josh came through with a baggie
Asked me if I was tryna chief said hell yeah gladly
Broke his bag down and said bro wanna match me?
Mmh that's what I was thinkin' exactly
I'm supposed to go to class now I'm reakin'
Eyes look bleedin' cause I couldn't wait til the weekend
I'm smokin' on the daily, I swear I keep trying
To quit and get focused or my teacher gon' fail me
About to get my 16th tardy this month
When you're dumb high naturally you miss stuff.
I'm sittin' in the back of the class fucked up
Jottin' in my rhyme book mad bored this sucks
After this I'm headed to the lab you already know
Teacher keeps staring down at me like I bet he knows
Spend my afternoon chillin blowin purple trees
H-h-hot damn this weed stronger than hercules
