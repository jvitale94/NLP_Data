Grab the iPhone and hit up fam and
Come through with a gram of that Oaksterdam
I only wanna get twisted everydays Christmas
I'm Dasher and you're Vixen
Fresh kicks, fresh clothes say I look cool
All we ever do is kick it bro fuck school
Fuck aprons and fuck washin' dishes
I only wanna smoke mad weed and fuck bitches


I'm in the back of my classroom super high
You'd probably do the same thing if you were I
I make music get chicks and I'm uber fly
See me on my BMX when I maneuver by
The smoothest guy that you've ever see
Shes a fan but shes a two so I let her dream
And I ain't never fucked the ugly girl ever
But I have woken up next to one go figure
A local celebrity to an extent
I've been on tours every single place that we went
I'm shuttin' shit down
I'm more popular than you are In your town
Heard the party up town was the place to go
Three dudes thirty chicks was the ratio
I'm in the backroom chillin' with a vacuum
I mean a bad ho gives intelligent fellatio

Knock knock it's the flow man
Draggin' my balls and no go hand
I know your life is a bitch with no sand
I can't help it that you livin' like an old man
Gettin through the day as long as I got ten bucks
PBR and a blunt keeps my head up
Eatin' every meal with a red cup
Keep it very real gotta fess up
I got haters, wishin' them the best lucky
While I take a pickin' from the best sluts
Man they say you really gotta catch up
Chickens in a pickle why they pickin' at my bread crumbs
Cut it - what they throwin' a fit for?
The only party in there life is the shit show
When I don't party my idea is to get dough
Music is my money and my favorite key is shift-4
Me and G-Eazy and Mikey, might be at the spot where the hot dykes be
Most likely we goin' be tardy you ain't' in a hurry when your life is a party
