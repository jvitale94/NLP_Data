

Baby, bounce to my rhythm, I be radiatin' static
With toys in my attic, styles automatic
I love'em Asiatic, Japanese and Puerto Rican
Every time I start speakin', I wind up freakin'
Some little fleusy naked in my jacuzzi
If ya think I'm not choosy than the joke's on you
You want the 411, baby here's my style
I like'em young but I'm no freakin' pedophile
I'm known to set it wild, young girls get creamy
Swing'em through the morn and the Ev will get steamy
You can't see me, I play the set low
Scrapin' on the bottom, smokin' L's if I got'em
And I ain't too proud to beg for your leg
Let me push up in the thighs, I'll fertilize your egg
Let me make your nature rise along with your blood pressure
Strip you down bare, lay your things on the dresser
While the children of the lesser, go out and play the hard rock role
Girl, I stay rock hard


So if I get mine, you'll get yours
And we can take it to the wild side behind closed doors
Rip off your stockings and drop your drawers
We can take it to the wild side behind closed doors

Ah baby, can't you feel it, deep down inside ya
I can't hide the fact I wanna ride ya
Body up and down and then back and forth
Kind of like Aaliyah, girl, I wanna see ya
Oh, you look good, honey bun, I can't fake it
And word is bond I just got to get you naked
And once you're naked I'm a lick your skin
Then touch you in spots that ain't nobody else been
I'll kiss you down there when you're bare
And I swear that I'll do it right
I'll make it last all night
But don't put up a fight
'Cause I ain't Macho Man Randy
I'm not a Savage, I just want some candy
And it's, fine and dandy if you need some time
But let me know whatcha think and, sugar, ease my mind
Let me know where I stand, come take my hand
Give me a hug, then lay me down on the rug
