Of the MCs that missed it would be the constitution
They play their caps backwards still saying wack words
No power to durhust just a few yes men

Raising the question of who gave you a contract
They should be fired you're officially retired

I see you make a little cash and start showing your ass
You get laced up with jewels your crews acting like fools
Playing hard rock surrounded by body guards
Hoping no one pulls your cord you got me laughing pretty hard

Thinking you're the white hot man of the hour
But you just cant figure how your flavor went sour
Back in 89 PE fought the power and in 86 Big Daddy Kane was raw

And I was right there on the first floor of the Palladium
You never played a venue local college or a stadium
A young boys fiddin' pad fad is now a grown mans profession
To earn this is a blessing

This skills have me guessing learn 'cause I'm testing
Follow this down no question, no doubt check it out

You be either rhyming in code or on some gangster node
You all clockwork apocalypse you about to implode
Collapsing on yourself 'cause your whole foundation is
Built on lies don't apologize

'Cause once they watch you rise they wanna watch you fall
And they'll all take a piece just like the Berlin wall
And place it on their mantle like a souvenir
And what they call a knick-knack is really your career

You ain't promise nothing but a pocket full of stress
Still there be people that would die for less
You ain't promise nothing but a heart full of sorrow
If they don't like the demo make a new one tomorrow

You ain't promise nothing but a pocket full of stress
Still there be people that would die for less
You ain't promise nothing but a heart full of sorrow
If they don't like the demo make a new one tomorrow

When it's time to rise I'll open the archives
When you be in dreams you got 85's
Chrome down with the leather package
You got a home of your own, you're holding acres

I got it made, season tickets to the Knickers and the Lakers
Playing both coasts closed and European festivals
Crowd scream decibels, Crowd scream decibels
In your ear you wanna make rapping your career

From Arkansas to Minnesota I sell out the quota
I be the wet dream making cream for promoters
We keep the sh*t right we don't be starting no fights
And he wont hold out my dough 'cause I'm a put out his lights

And once the crew hits the stage the crowd gets involved
We show love they show it back all problems solved
You can boom shalock and jump to the sounds I pump
But I ain't quitting till I'm shitting on Donald Trump

So take heed to the verses and styles and versions
When you socialize with other MCs
And boast your rhymes to company enemies
And in any cases that feel is what you want


She want to make money, money and take every honey
Rap charges ain't funny but it boost your career
Your penile style is now hanging from a tier

Now you wanna know fear to impress your peers
Now your ass outta here the rap game goes on

You ain't promise nothing but a pocket full of stress
Still there be people that would die for less
You ain't promise nothing but a heart full of sorrow
If they don't like the demo make a new one tomorrow

You ain't promise nothing but a pocket full of stress
Still there be people that would die for less
You ain't promise nothing but a heart full of sorrow
If they don't like the demo make a new one tomorrow
