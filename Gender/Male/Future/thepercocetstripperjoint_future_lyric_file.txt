My passion is a movie, I say fuck it ‘cause that’s ruder
I stay on Miley Cyrus, everyone I go I’m screwed up
I know my Texas niggas got my back and that’s for sure though
Sipping on Easter Pink like it's tangarang lean
Never gonna do this, fuck your life
I know the boys saying they getting into the money over there
Baby trust me, these niggas nothing like us
I put charisma in my new girl when she fell for me
I gave her realness, it’s all she gonna get from me
Bonefidé superstar I’m straight up out the hood, uh
I just did a dose of percocet with some strippers

I just did a dose of percocet with some strippers
I just poured this lean in my cup like it's liquor
I just need a whole lot of drugs in my system
I just tried acid for the first time, I feel good

Treasure bring misery, codeine in my delivery
I pulled up in a big B, swerving like a hippy
Moving with the dopers and pushers
In the rover ducking undercover hugging the interstate
Copping a couple cakes and the drum hanging under me
Got a chain hanging over me, God watching over me
All my angels watch over me, I bag it like groceries
Keep this cash going over me
Got some money all in my hand and I stack it all under me
Young niggas under me they gon stand up and then do what?
Who built this shit ground up? At the head of a seminar
I talk for the real ones, I talk for them niggas
They feel this shit out in Belgium
Free band game

I just did a dose of percocet with some strippers
I just poured this lean in my cup like it's liquor
I just need a whole lot of drugs in my system
I just tried acid for the first time, I feel good
