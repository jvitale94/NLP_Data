Foreign whips, it call me by a couple grands
Foreign bitches, only tell em bring a friend
Hunned deep, every g, fuckin taliban
Thuggin in money, bad bitch’s upon me
No need to be stunting, money keep on comin

That dirty money like diddy, my bad bitches they pretty
My chains will leave you dizzy,
I’m staying up on my grizzy
I’m stacking money like 50
I’m more versace than biggy
I’m popping bands like diggy, my night  future simmons
I’m most requested in clubs, I’m making girls fall in love
I’m popping bottles of bud, if I make it rain it’s gonn flood
Once I make it rain it’s gonn thunder
I’m ballin like oklahoma
I’m chasin after them come up
You got benjamins then I want em
You got franklins then I need em
That  girl is a diva
I might just have to freeze
She gonn  she believe me
Making moves is like steven
A foreign bitch from new zeeland
Her friend don’t even speak english!


Dirty money, keep that shit in rubber bands
Foreign whips, it call me by a couple grands
Foreign bitches, only tell em bring a friend
Hunned deep, every g, fuckin taliban
Thuggin in money, bad bitch’s upon me
No need to be stunting, money keep on comin

Drop that money, flip it like a cogwheel
Bitch tell me how that foreign car feel
Smokin purple got the whole car filled
So much money, why the fuck I rap still?
Money all in my pocket, rubber bands keep poppin
Thinking hustle, hustle, hustle
Like nah nigga I ain’t stoppin
See my jug  keep boomin
Drop top and I’m coolin
I’m foolin, nah, nigga out here doing what we doing
See the young niggas is poppin now
Pluto we ain’t comin down, nah

Scooter say it’s all about the cash money
Stripper bitches love shaking ass for me


Dirty money, keep that shit in rubber bands
Foreign whips, it call me by a couple grands
Foreign bitches, only tell em bring a friend
Hunned deep, every g, fuckin taliban
Thuggin in money, bad bitch’s upon me
No need to be stunting, money keep on comin

I’m strapped up, the cannon in my pack
And just let it out, I remix it, pack it up
Then I put it back in the band
I’m super future, I’m jammin the roof
And panoramic the coupe
Got brain damage, I’m a freeband gang bandit
I’m  salute me, I’m going crazy
I get blowed until I’m faded,
I trap until they rate it
I hustle I ain’t made it
I’m scorching on fire blazin
You wish you were that fresh
You see how I’m dressed
Got a foreign bitch on deck
She know I got that check


Dirty money, keep that shit in rubber bands
Foreign whips, it call me by a couple grands
Foreign bitches, only tell em bring a friend
Hunned deep, every g, fuckin taliban
Thuggin in money, bad bitch’s upon me
No need to be stunting, money keep on comin.
