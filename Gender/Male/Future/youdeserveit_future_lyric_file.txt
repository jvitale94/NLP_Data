You deserve it
You deserve it, Future
You deserve it

You deserve it
You deserve it
You deserve it, Future
You deserve it

I done paid so many dues
I never lose my cool
Just the other day, my lil' cousin call me from school and said

You deserve it
You deserve it
You deserve it, Future
You deserve it
(Turn it up)


Ain't asked for this, I worked for this
I was in the dungeon, that place's a sin
Catch the jiggers, not paying attention
No harm, nigga, my slang tremendous
I'm better than you and I know it
I will show it
You ain't flowin' how I'm flowin'
That's why I'm goin'
Places you ain't goin'
No one can go in
They knowin' it and I'm glowin'
To a mother I come up with discretion
I pick that up from rico
My cousin had my back from day one
Gon' keep a month up

Keep it slammin', tell the T when I was standin' on the corner
Went to studio, just put that crack of heavy on it




I go so fuckin' hard, till my heart skip a beat
I always been expensive, ain't nothin' about me cheap
I'm tha realest nigga you'll see
Since Michael Jackson â€“ Billie Jean
I was plannin' can't even rappin'
Sometimes I feel I wanna sing
My passion (my passion)
It goes without bein' said
Tha fruits of my labor
I laid down a solid foundation
You water a seed too long and it will grow
You stay down and grind for long and it's gon show
It brings water to my eyes just to hear me on the radio
You wouldn't understand the route I had to take to get here so
I worked for this (I worked for this)
It didn't come easy (It didn't come easy)
My people hit me up and said these rappers cheezy, cause
