


Codeine crazy, yeah
Pour that bubbly, pour that bubbly
Pour that bubbly, pour that bubbly
Pour that bubbly, we done went through too much
You hear me?


Pour that bubble in, drink that muddy drink that muddy drink that muddy
When we're cuddling, yeah I'm covered in
I was thugging it, I was just loving it
That's for them other niggas, for
They ain't for you dog, thats for them other niggas
That ain't for you shorty, thats for the other bitches
I'm going crazy bout it, I'm going codeine crazy
Thats how I'm living it, I'm feeling lovely
I'm drinking bubbly


Take all my problems and drink out the bottle and fuck on a model, yeah
Audemar, this not a carnival, but this is a royal Cartier
Don Peringnon I get down with the brown, I just shuffle around
I pour up with my rounds, I pour up out of town
I can rip through your town with them guns and them pounds
I grew up on them grounds with the dealers and hound
We order more bottles and fuck on more models and pass em around
I say everything triple time, Rollie, AP, Hublot triple time
I just know the ones you call upon, I just had to pay my dawg a bond
Looking at me like a triple threat, everytime a nigga talk a check
Smoke the kush up like a cigarette, Run it back you hear my intellect

Celebrate like a championship, celeberate like a championship
Celebrate like a championship, celeberate like a championship
I told you I told you I told you I told you I told you I told you


Dont tell me you celibate to the mula, I just went Rick the Ruler with the jeweler
I just wish you'd stop perpetrating like a goonie
I adopted niggas straight out the sewer
Like a loaded chopper, I'm 'bout to shoot it
I'm so fucking sick and tired of these rumors
I just dived inside a cutie, we spoonin'
Take it back and take a look at yourself
Take the lesson; put it all in the air
Too many days gone by
Sittin' by the phone - waitin' 'til I reply
Drying my eyes, believe it or not
I could never see a tear fallin'
Water drippin' off of me like a faucet
I just took a bitch to eat at Chipotle
Spent another 60 thousand on a Rollie
All my diamonds got you brainwashed, she sucked my dick and got my brainwashed
And for the shit it got your man popped
See what they did to Biggie and Pac
Pour a lil' liquor, pour more lil' liquor
Pour it up pour it up pour it up


Codeine crazy, codeine crazy
Codeine crazy, codeine crazy
Codeine crazy, codeine crazy
All this motherfucking money got me going codeine crazy


Drownin' in Actavis, suicide
When I hit the scene it’s homicide
Diamond pinky ring – a lollipop
Fuck the hate – I pull up in a drop
Diamonds colder than a glacier
Ballin’ harder than the Pacers
I been tryin’ to have some patience
Told my momma she should pray on it
Told the streets they gotta wait on it
She gonna put a nigga name on it
I just dropped a whole thang on it
I’m making U.S.D's overseas
That’s U.S. dollars that you can’t achieve
Fucked my white girl, she said “Nigga please.”
Fuck that white girl, she said “Nigga please.”

Playin’ poker – now we’re back at Stroker
I forgot her name, but her pussy’s soakin’
When I seen her on a pole…
Reminded myself when I used to come over
Reminded myself when I used to get loaded
Remindin’ myself that I’m still gettin’ loaded
The coupe fully loaded. This whip fully loaded
This whip fully loaded. The clip fully loaded
I try to control this
Let's wrap up some bottles, let's pop off some bottles
These niggas who bogus, let's pour up propane
I'ma fuck around and faint like I'm Kid Cudi probably
I fuck around and faint, I'ma fall on a drink
Rockin’ Tom Ford. Poppin’ molly
Married to this motherfuckin’ money




You thought I forgot about us? I know that you know I dont fold under pressure
I'm back on the road, I get low on the pedal
We live by the codes of the ghetto
I'm closing this out with my memo, im treating this shit like a demo
I'm putting my heart and my soul in the shit and some mo'
I'm in that dolce gabbana, I might get after madonna
I get the crack in the summer, trapping in the lac and the hummer
Fronting some crack to my partner, all this lingo got her panties to dropping
Fuck the fame I'm sipping lean when I'm driving, all this cash and it ain't nowhere to hide it
I'm an addict and I can't even hide it, Don’t you panic panoramic companion
They was tryna' serve me at the arraignment, never comment on it, never complaining
I'm taking everything that comes with these millions
I'm taking everything that comes with my children
Yeah
