The coolest dj in the world
G for Global
Yea we global now
Forever

I put spikes around my jacket
And I'm strapped up with a ratchet
I'm chasing after paper
I became a savage
A nigga set my nigga up
The game is full of madness
Sometimes I wanna get inside that Escalade and crash it
My pain running deeper than the ocean (it is)
My pain running deeper than the ocean (no tears)
My pain running deeper than the ocean (I can take it)
Pain running deeper than the ocean

Leather jackets
No motorcycle
I'm spiked up like a bad drink
9 to 3
That good supreme
Where all the scissile
Boy guillotine
I work hard and it came out
I turnt up
Turn the bitch off
Then I went from dead broke
To laying up in a penthouse
There are no secret
When you leaking
I woke up the evening
And I seen a demon
I'm on that rare codeine
Trying to clear my thoughts
Niggas won't feel my pain
All they see is fame
And what it bring
I paid dues
Graduated from finesse schools
I showed and proved
I never lose
I'm too smart
I should have went to Harvard
Drinking out the bottle
Holding maseratti

I put spikes around my jacket
And I'm strapped up with a ratchet
I'm chasing after paper
I became a savage
A nigga set my nigga up
And game is full of madness
Sometimes I wanna get inside that Escalade and crash it
My pain running deeper than the ocean (it is)
My pain running deeper than the ocean (no tears)
My pain running deeper than the ocean (I can take it)
Pain running deeper than the ocean

Taking three drugs at one time
Take em one time
And you niggas start hating on future
For one time
I commit a million crimes
That ain't enough for you
I'ma say a million rhyme
All the shit I've been through
I was grinding hard
Niggas try to hold me back
They didn't wanna see me with the plug
They didn't wanna see me with the sack
I got it though
It worked out
I kept the lawyer
I set standards
And now I'm royal
Niggers try to chase the paper
Then you got to take his life
Till we get screaming
I can't sleep right
Then they put a hit on your head
Then you walk around with a price
Million ain't way what you see
Better go good on sight

I put spikes around my jacket
And I'm strapped up with a ratchet
I'm chasing after paper
I became a savage
A nigga set my nigga up
And game is full of madness
Sometimes I wanna get inside that Escalade and crash it
My pain running deeper than the ocean (it is)
My pain running deeper than the ocean (no tears)
My pain running deeper than the ocean (I can take it)
Pain running deeper than the ocean
