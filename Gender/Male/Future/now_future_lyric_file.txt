50 round carbine on me right now
Got 100 round drum on the seat right now
I got your bitch and she with me now
I had a sip on that codeine now
I like to pull up in Bentleys now
My goons get it done with a mac 11
You nigga gon' ride for the shit we reppin'
Be cool on that fuck shit
And Nell on that fuck shit
We work that dope out the mud pit
We on that dope and that mud shit
We tryna sell niggas some love shit

Niggas try to flex they mussels on us
We cut 'em off and bought some better choppas
We'll fuck you bitches, let my brother hit 'em
Fuck you niggas, let my robbers get 'em
They just wanna see me out my mental
Wanna fuck some commas up at my dealer
Fuck you lemma up doin' numbers
Pop a molly up, I remember
Better put your Mrs. up Imma get her
Fuck her in the mouth and then kiss her
Got the crib out with all pistols
I got my grill in, 20 thousand
For the few chains, that a new raise
I got this cute dame, give a fuck about her
She want all this fame and a million dollars
I done took this pain and I'm none of--
Keep a few rings, give a fuck about 'em
I'm in that new Range, give a fuck about 'em
50 grand on the Mulsanne
Sippin' drank at the Blue Flame
Hit the booth, let the booth flame
We ain't never cool, we just say that shit
For this bitch, you gotta play my shit
Run it back and then say my shit

All that old shit, y'all niggas still doing it
I'm over that
All that old shit, y'all niggas still doing
Dawg, I'm over now
All that old shit, y'all niggas still doing
Dawg, I'm over that
All that old shit, y'all niggas still doing
