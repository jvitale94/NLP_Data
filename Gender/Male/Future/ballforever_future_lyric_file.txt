Money to the ceiling
Ice in the Mediterranean Sea(Ayeee)
Racks taller than the building
Spend that lil band like they free
Ima ball forever

I should've went pro
Order up the ones and let it go
Ima ball forever
Worth a couple million on the low
This a public info you need to know
Ima ball forever


I'm lookin' up the money swimmin' in them diamonds
Micro cord gold piece naw this ain't no timing
Throw it up in 'undred get right back out the pirate
I got bangs on bangs anytime perfect timing
Ballin' with no budget get a rental car from budget
Got the waitress at the pink pony ridin with the luggage
After this transaction come through star studded
Hell naw ion a star but my chain still flooded

I can make 20 bands off it and ion have to touch it
On my way to 5th plaza hit Gucci in a rush
Just done fucked them bangs up real nigga gettin money
Man you gotta stand up you know they can't tame us

Pluto you wanna bite the kid its cool though
Killed a half a million dollar licking copper too though
I'm outta here ain't gone never come to earth again
Ridin around city with the calculator gettin it in (Racks)
Fade away jump shot it ain't in a spin
Hit the club and throw it up nigga
