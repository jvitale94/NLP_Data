On the phone, cooking dope, at the same damn time
Selling white, selling mid, at the same damn time
Fucking 2 bad bitches at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
I'm in pluto I'm in mars at the same damn time
On the sofa, poppin bottles at the same damn time


Boy your money and my money ain't the same damn kind,
I could live your life and my life at the same damn time,
See my riding out money, that's your buy your house money,
I got that "I could build a mall right by your house money",
Hold up, say you got that 550 you talking bout that Benz nigga,
Say I got that 550 I'm talking about them M's nigga, all black phantom white seats,
I killed them bring them white sheets,
Said oh I think she like me cause I cop Maybachs like white tees,
I'm in Times, People, Fortune, Forbes, same damn time, XXL, GQ, Vibe, Source, same damn time,
Nigga you don't live that shit that's in your lame ass rhymes,
Y'all done woke a sleeping giant now the game back mine.


I wear gucci, I wear bally at the same damn time
On the phone, cooking dope, at the same damn time
Selling white, selling mid, at the same damn time
Fucking 2 bad bitches at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
I'm in pluto I'm in mars at the same damn time
On the sofa, poppin bottles at the same damn time


I'm in fifs with the sack going crazy
Got some diamonds around my neck no flugazy
Bad bitches in the suite, trying to bathe me
Just a young hood nigga, streets raised me
Working with a unit try and stretch it to another one
Drinking on that active and it taste just like some bubble gum
Thumbing through a check, boarding on the jet
Talking on the iphone, sipping out the styrofoam
That dirty got my mind gone, that money got my mind blown
Vvs and white stones, vvs and white stones
I'm rolling like a rolling stone
Free bands on al capone
And my cash way long, (turned up)
I see a bunch of clones


I wear gucci, I wear bally at the same damn time
On the phone, cooking dope, at the same damn time
Selling white, selling mid, at the same damn time
Fucking 2 bad bitches at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
I'm in pluto I'm in mars at the same damn time
On the sofa, poppin bottles at the same damn time


Luda is unstoppable his money is astronomical,
Sell as many records as a nigga like me that shit is just impossible,
Rappers is delusional and now they talkin' more shit,
Anything is liable to come out of the mouth of a desperate starving broke bitch,
Tell bitch, you used to be good but now you garbage,
Any nigga that wanna step up to the plate and battle will get demolished,
My flows is rubbin' off like just like they finger nail polish,
You rappers ain't got no swag you need to kill your fuckin' styilst,
They bitin' like piranhas, they cryin' to they momma,
These niggas besta call they troops back like obama,
That trash that ya spitted didn't phase me,
Matter fact ya record label still pays me,
See luda never startin' shit I'm always on my grind,
But I'll respond three rappers at the same damn time.


I wear gucci, I wear bally at the same damn time
On the phone, cooking dope, at the same damn time
Selling white, selling mid at the same damn time
Fucking 2 bad bitches at the same damn time
I'm in pluto I'm in mars at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
I'm in pluto I'm in mars at the same damn time
On the sofa, poppin bottles at the same damn time.
