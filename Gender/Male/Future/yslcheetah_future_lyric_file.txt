Splash in the sauce, side me is like bary geeda
Tiger strike Versace, all the girls exotic
Ice playing hockey, I can see you but you watching

Tiger strike Versace got me acting lil verace
Shoe games far, eat Christian not horacis
European jackets, I got scarfs on a tire
Fresh... lil nigga I'm messiah
Gucci's on my face and I'm looking right by you
Ysl hot tubs, man on fire
Denzel Washington key way flier
Chick on your hit, young nigga we will but her
Audemar from davis, swirl in the water
Adding 30 pounders, little cost up and extra corner
25 racks to the future, that's from deal main
Million dollar city, yeah I'm getting real money

Wearing up sweaters, cost a main treasure
White canary yellow, purple or the yellow
Codeine habits, the Honda for the carriage
Took it in the goose shirt cause I don't like to wear it
Boss of the century, iPad memory
Thousand dollars shoe game, boosting up my energy
Versaces on the sofa, made the bitch super soak
Burberry blazer with the red bottom loafers
Every single color, I'm a free bands hustler
Ysl cheetah, pay my feet inside the jungle
Money over bitches, swear to God I never love them
Rock star life they call me future hugh hefner

I told her ride it like a rarri, pop it like a molly
Ysl belt, and my jeans is cavali
Red bottoms on like my feet just caught a body
Red bottoms on like my feet just caught a body
I'm the hottest and the coldest, the flies and you nodes
Balence I got sneakers, stepping on you cockroaches
My chain cost a kilo, that don't include the piece though
That cost another kilo, my watch another kilo
All the girls they love me, I was taught to get money
Look down in my rollie, it's always time to get money
They get fly, I am fly, they burn fly, I'm jet fly
While animals, I wear those
They friendly, come pet mine
