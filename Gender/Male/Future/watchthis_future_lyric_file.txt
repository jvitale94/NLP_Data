FreeBandz nigga!

Aye watch me watch how it dance,
Watch it light up and glist
Watch this chain how it shine
Watch it wink and it kiss
Watch the movie, young homie I see you watchin this shit
Watch me walk in the club,
Watch how crazy it get
Watch this, watch this
Aye watch this, aye watch this
Watch this, aye watch this
Man watch this, Man watch this
See you standin there just watchin, I'm a give you somethin to look at
Standin there just watchin I'm a give you somethin to look at
(Watch this)

Ya standin there just watchin I'm a give you somethin to look at
All these damn diamonds, man just mothafuckin look at
Keep that shit a milli
I'd be lyin if I ain't dilly
Got them True Religion billings pop so many tags, it's silly
My dog called a 30, and they say he gone appeal it,
I'm blowin through the racks like a fan on da ceiling
She got that stupid brain, But my heart ain't got no feeling
I'm iced out forreal dawg, I'm pourin up trippin,
Slowin up my motions like my diamonds black might feel me,
My nigga rolling stone, we some mothafuckin hippies
Got a hundred thousand soldiers I ain't mothafuckin slippin
I can wear my ice anywhere without no supervision

Aye watch me watch how it dance,
Watch it light up and glist
Watch this chain how it shine
Watch it wink and it kiss
Watch the movie, young homie I see you watchin this shit
Watch me walk in the club,
Watch how crazy it get
Watch this, watch this
Aye watch this, aye watch this
Watch this, aye watch this
Man watch this, Man watch this
See you standin there just watchin, I'm a give you somethin to look at
Standin there just watchin I'm a give you somethin to look at

I'm a cold hard criminal, everythang flashin
Young rich nigga, all my hoes gettin nasty
Booty shakin bitches, love a nigga with Fantastic
See the money comin, I'm a flip it like Gymnastic,
10 band jewels that ain't even worth my glasses,
Moscato and Patron, Platinum dumpin out the ashes,
Scrolled like aspen, Designer are my passion,
Fuck ya babymomma like Kourtney Kardashian,
Scotty call my phone, I be pickin up laughin
Sixth fifth shoppin, true story, I ain't braggin
I'd like to thank my jeweler, all these bad bitches I'm baggin
Check like mine, no talk straight smashin

Aye watch me watch how it dance,
Watch it light up and glist
Watch this chain how it shine
Watch it wink and it kiss
Watch the movie, young homie I see you watchin this shit
Watch me walk in the club,
Watch how crazy it get
Watch this, watch this
Aye watch this, aye watch this
Watch this, aye watch this
Man watch this, Man watch this
See you standin there just watchin, I'm a give you somethin to look at
Standin there just watchin I'm a give you somethin to look at
