

I got a bitch stay in the hood
With a whole quarter key
With that chopper in her name
And keep it right on the seat
Man these niggas say they fly
But they ain't fly like me
Turn it up a notch
Then they follow my lead
They tryin they best 2 shine
They tryin they best to take off
They tryin they best 2 shine
They tryin they best to take off
They tryin they best 2 shine
They tryin they best to take off
They tryin they best 2 shine
They tryin they best to take off

I took the profit from the coke
And slapped it right on my feet
I tried to hide a half million cash
It took me some weeks
Man that bitch got some head so good
You gone swear she ain't got no teeth
I mixed that Molly with that Nina
We laid up in the suit
I'm in the hood posted up
I know the police gone sweep
I keep a hood hoe
So I can keep that dope where she sleep
She down for a nigga
And she ride with her fo-fif
I put the AK in the name
But I keep it on me
I'm brand new when i step out
From my head to my feet
These niggas studying my photos
Trying they best to compete
I got a style so outrageous
I come through like a chief
I'm the commander on these streets
All you niggas know me

I got a bitch stay in the hood
With a whole quarter key
With that chopper in her name
And keep it right on the seat
Man these niggas say they fly
But they ain't fly like me
Turn it up a notch
Then they follow my lead
They tryin they best 2 shine
They tryin they best to take off
They tryin they best 2 shine
They tryin they best to take off
They tryin they best 2 shine
They tryin they best to take off
They tryin they best 2 shine
They tryin they best to take off

I Put Versace on my denim
I'm a lion at heart
I was selling dope like everyday
Till I topped the charts
I serve my same clientele
Cause these cars unmarked
I'm runnin up to every car
Before the car even park
We went from Reebok and Girbaund
Now it's Louis Vuitton
You want to be future
I look at you just like you my son
I got a rap check
And all I hang around is that scum
And if I ever get in trouble
My bitch gone pay my bond
I told that bitch I need a yappa
And she went to the pawn
And I didn't have to tell her twice
Cause it was already done
These niggas showing off for me
So now they ordering ups one's
Been on some futuristic shit
Now I'm back where I begun

I got a bitch stay in the hood
With a whole quarter key
With that chopper in her name
And keep it right on the seat
Man these niggas say they fly
But they ain't fly like me
Turn it up a notch
Then they follow my lead
They tryin they best 2 shine
They tryin they best to take off
They tryin they best 2 shine
They tryin they best to take off
They tryin they best 2 shine
They tryin they best to take off
They tryin they best 2 shine
They tryin they best to take off

Put the codeine in the spite
And then I have me a drink
Smelling like a pound of loud
When I step in the bank
Future razor blade sharp
In the club with my shank
I'm on my rock star campaign
And I'm cool as you thank
You need to turn it to the max
If you want to turn up
You brought your girl to the club
But she leaving with us
I'm mashing off in the coop
Getting some head from a slut
And she catching everything
She wont spit it back up
I bought that bitch some Red Bottoms
Cause she down for the key
And she owns so many guns
She worst than Billy the Kid
I put that semi automatic in her name
And she with it
When you pull up with that cash
She gone serve you them fishes

I got a bitch stay in the hood
With a whole quarter key
With that chopper in her name
And keep it right on the seat
Man these niggas say they fly
But they ain't fly like me
Turn it up a notch
Then they follow my lead
They tryin they best 2 shine
They tryin they best to take off
They tryin they best 2 shine
They tryin they best to take off
They tryin they best 2 shine
They tryin they best to take off
They tryin they best 2 shine
They tryin they best to take off
