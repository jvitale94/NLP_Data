Ain't no way around it
Ain't no way around it
Ain't no way around it


A bitch gone be a bitch
A hoe gone be a hoe
A killer gone be a killer
That's sumthin' you need to know
Ain't no way around it, ain't no way around it
Ain't no way around it, ain't no way around it.
A dealer gone be a dealer
A plug gone be a plug
My niggas, them my niggas, we just like blood
Ain't no way around it, ain't no way around it
Ain't no way around it, ain't no way around it.


I know dis young, hot thang fucked my bro & gave 'em brain
And she expect for me to love her, I can never be a lame
I'm attracted to her sexually, but she ain't my main thang
We can be the best of friends, shawty, but you off the chain
See I ain't gonna hold it against ya
I'm a keep it pimpin' with ya
Don't you come at me with issues
Ain't tryna get all in your mixture
I ain't tryna come to get ya
You can meet me somewhere on Peachtree
At the W on the Fourteenth ain't tryna fuck no hoe tryna know me
Know you wanna fuck my wodie
Already smashed the homie
Half Of These Bitches Phony
Singin A Lil Song Like Toni
Ms.Braxton you action, stop actin'
Just a 'nother sad love song waitin' to happen




Strapped, With That Flame
And He Ready To Bust A Brain
You Can't Tell The Homie Nothin
He Dunn Felt Too Much Pain
He Dunn Care No Bout no Fame
He Addicted To The Game
Some Niggas ROB
Some Niggas SLANG

Bigger The Risk The Bigger The Check
We Watch For PO-PO
Make Sure You Keep Ya Eyes Open
When You Drivin Down 1-0
That Interstate Ain't No Joke
When You Ridin With Co-Co
When You Got Hands Like These
You Can Count Money With Your Eyes Closed
When You Spend Cheese Like This
You Send Killas To Niggas Front Door
Half Of These Niggas Front For
Bitches For Extra Convo
Really Plugged In With MIGOS
Go Blind And Still Can C-NOTES
