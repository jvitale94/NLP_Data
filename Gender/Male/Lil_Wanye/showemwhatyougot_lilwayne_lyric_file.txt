Show em you the shit
Go on throw it to the wall, something gonna stick, believe that
Fuck these other bitches don't trip
You've been working too hard, tell em niggas cut the check

I know you hustle baby I ain't gotta tell ya
You can give it everything but they take it if you let em
But, bills don't stop so you keep the money coming
Cause you taking care of mama, lil brother, baby cousin
The way you move you're body girl you know your gonna get it
How the fuck you else you going where the shoe ain't fitted?
Say hi to every hater, take a picture screen saver
Throw the middle finger, tell em bitches see ya later

Fuck these other bitches, don't trip

Goin pick up all this money, I know you don't mind
Go on take it to the back and count every single dime

Show em what you got baby
Show em you the shit
Go on throw it to the wall, baby something gonna give

With your pretty little buttons you a pretty little flower
So when they talk money, baby tell em talk louder
Cause all that bullshit is smoke signals to the rider
You in it for the commission
Every muthafucking dollar

The way that body movin' it's hard to understand
You ain't never been a bitch to execute without the plan
I ain't never seen a mark supplier without demand
And fuck credit baby tell em broke niggas stop playing

Gun snooze off?, just take them shoes off
Let me get that all, that body so soft
Cause you know it's gon count baby if you gon give it
And know it ain't a life if you don't live it, baby
