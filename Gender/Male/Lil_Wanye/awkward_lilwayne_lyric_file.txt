So we don't do that much talking
Sometimes it feels so awkward
She watch me take a shower
I asked her why she didn't join me
She said because you didn't ask me
I said damn,
I didn't think I had to
Then she take off my towel,
And I-I take off her blouse
I tell her that that pussy for me
Just incase she thought it was ours
And she say cool
And if you like it I love it
If she like it I love it
See we ain't got much in common
So we don't do that much talking
Cause everytime she try to tell me something
She open up her mouth and I stick my tongue in
She got a piercing in her vagina
A skirt with nothing under
And she say when she don't see me,
She feel like Stevie Wonder
That's when I said
Work, Work, Work
If you want that purse,
Skirt, shirt
She made me cum 100 times
She made me cum 100 times
She got that Work, Work, Work
I say you my bitch now
I'm calling you first
And then made her cum a 100 times
She kinda green but I'm color blind
See we ain't got much in common
So we don't do that much talking
Sometimes it feels so awkward
She watch me take a shower
I asked her why she didn't join me
She said because you didn't ask me
I said damn I didn't think I had to
Then she take off my towel
And I-I take off her blouse
I tell her that that pussy for me
Just incase she thought it was ours
And she say cool
Uh I like that shit
And she bite that lip
When she like that dick
Oooh I like that shit
And she bite that lip
Don't fight that dick girl...
