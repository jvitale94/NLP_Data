Everythings alright
Everything is alright


Pop a bottle and celebrate
We made it to a new day
Pop a bottle and celebrate
We done made it to a new day
Oooh I take a hit and just elevate
Cause today will be a good day
I got my mind right, money right
Ready for war, work hard today for a better tomorrow

I said who’s that peeking in my window
Is that sunshine, is that one time
Let that sunshine through my living room
Hospitality is what I’m giving you
Harsh reality is what I’ve been through
But I’m not alone, ask her and him too
And they shall tell ya, ain’t nothin’ better
Than the smell of a new day
And I know the ocean runs dry and the sky get dark
And ya don’t see what He’s trying to show ya
And I know the wall will seem tall but if we help eachother I guarantee we get over
And once I’m over, I’ll reach back for my brother and pull him over aswell
Keep our heads high and our noses wide open
Hoping for that new day smell
Love live life


Pop a bottle and celebrate
We made it to a new day
Pop a bottle and celebrate
We done made it to a new day
Oooh I take a hit and just elevate
Cause today will be a good day
I got my mind right, money right
Ready for war, working hard today for a better tomorrow
