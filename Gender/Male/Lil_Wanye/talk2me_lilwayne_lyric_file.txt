If you want it, you can get it
All you gotta do is hit me and it's on
I know it's been a minute, and you ain't got time for gimmicks
But I'm comin' to my senses, I was wrong (I was wrong)
But when you roll like me, on your own like me
You gonna wake up all alone and you will see, see, see
I'm at an all time low, we don't talk no more
'Cause I want you back, I need you girl, that's all I know

Now talk to me, talk to me, talk
Walk with me, walk with me, walk
I know these things that we said
How can we stop and leave all?

How can we ruin something so perfect, so fluent?
We was young, we was dumb, we ain't know what was doing
But now that we older, older
Lets take these things slower, slower
Reset the button, button
And start it all over, over
I cannot stop what I feel, you ain't a notch in my belt
I ain't gonna lie to you girl, I want you all to myself
And forgive for being stingy though
Take you all the places that you swear you never been before
Why is this so difficult? This should be the easy part
Believe me if you need me, ain't no way we finna keep apart

No matter where I go, no matter who I'm with
I always think of you, 'cause baby you the shhh
I love your body, girl, there's no denying that
I will not rest, I will not sleep, like an insomniac
I keep you up all night, you know I get it right
I give it to you fast or slow, or any way you like
So give it one more chance
Now how you want it,
If we pick up where we parted
We can finish what we started, girl...
