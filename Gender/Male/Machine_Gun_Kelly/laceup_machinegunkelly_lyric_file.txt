I need to see the motherfucking L's in the air!


Ok, where the strong at?

Smoke another green be looking like where the long at
And you know I'm gonna raise till I'm face up
Fuck check-out time, we don't wake up
Damn these EST boy's done came up
Dirty ass Chucks and a bad bitch lace up
Lace up

Where my east-side motherfuckers? Laced Up!
Where my west-side motherfuckers? Laced Up!

All I know, all I know
I am from the city where the grass don't grow
I am from the city in the middle of the map
Where half these motherfuckers that rap don't go
All I know, all I know
If I throw this cash then her ass get slow
But I am from the city where the cash don't blow
So I came up for myself and smash that ho
Smash that ho, smash that ho
Treat her like a Bop It and I pass that ho
And I ain't saying nothing that my fans don't know
I'm an EST boy till the casket close
Six foot deep, six foot three
Eight motherfuckers in the SUV
Eight new states in a seven day week
Whole world laced up like some brand new sneaks
Yeah
And they know I'm gonna raise till I'm face up
Fuck check-out time, we don't wake up
Damn these EST boy's done came up
Dirty ass Chucks and a bad bitch lace up




Run through the motherfucking club, pushin'
Move bitches out the fucking way, mush 'em
Wave my drink in the motherfucking air, fuck it
Shady in my motherfucking hood, I rep it
Bitches getting out of fucking line, check 'em
{} my motherfucking nuts, shuck 'em
Drank too much fucking liquor, I'm fucked up
L's in the motherfucking air, we laced up

We laced up
