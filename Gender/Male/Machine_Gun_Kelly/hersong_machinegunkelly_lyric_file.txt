Shit


Oh these times are hard
Yeah they're making us crazy
Don't give up on me baby
(Sing)
Oh these times are hard
(Hard)
Yeah they're making us crazy
(Crazy)
Don't give up on me baby
(Baby)


I'm just out here chasing my dreams girl
But it's crazy cause that dream cost me my dream girl
Promise you I wouldn't change before I left
Now I think leaving is the one thing I regret
Cause the one thing I possess
It wasn't materials, wasn't checks, wasn't cars, wasn't clothes, or any part of success
It was you,
And without that in my life I'm depressed,
You became the new drug I couldn't get
And every time you came over I was on some shit, either too fucked up, or bitchin about how you dress
Even though I remember when you would lay with me when I ain't have a bed,
Buy me food and come wake me up with some head
You had me like a Dread locked down
But I wouldn't show it, instead got on that bus and left you blowing in the wind
Shit and it's fucked up cause every girl I'm with I see your face
Now summers here and I'm sitting outside your place singing this shit


Oh these times are hard
Yeah they're making us crazy
(What I gotta do to get you back?)
Don't give up on me baby
(I gotta sing to you? Haa)
Oh these times are hard
(Hard)
Yeah they're making us crazy
(Makin us crazy)
Don't give up on me baby
(Yeah)


I never thought for a minute, if you showed me a picture of my life now, that you wouldn't be in it
Took me a couple years to say I loved you, but I meant it
When I said it, wasn't much of a romantic, but you get it
Didn't really smoke, but when I rolled it up you hit it, and we lit it up,
Shotgun in our kisses
And fuck these other bitches baby, fuck these other bitches in my bunk
Staring up at all your pictures that you sent me on my birthday, remember that? Cause I couldn't forget it
Like I forgot yours, but I'm sorry and I said it, I admit it, I fucked up, and I lied, but this is true
I don't know what home is because I'm lost without you,
Just like our favorite song, yeah blink 182
Now I just turn it off, when it comes on, I wish I hated you
I used to have someone at 3am that I could call, now it just rings and I don't get nothing at all
Where you at girl?



 Come on pick up... Yeah hold on give me a minute

Oh these times are hard
Yeah they're making us crazy
Don't give up on me baby
Oh these times are hard
Yeah they're making us crazy
Don't give up on me baby
