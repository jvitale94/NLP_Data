Since like sixth grade you know what I mean
Kells held me down a lot my cousin held me
Down a lot and that's really it people fall off real quick when
You're in here

Ay tell'em imma need a minute, damn
My heads fucked up I be thinkin' jail whenever hear'em
Say they need a sentence I be in the booth zoned out
They say they just need a couple lines and
The years on the road got me thinkin' blow
Even though they just wanted some bars like jail time
See there I go, somebody this drink from me, I love my bitches oh
Please god don't let them take none of the paint from me
And since you need a filler for the dead space
Sorry I had to get my head straight one of the homies back
Home caught a fed case
And how I'm suppose to feel when I'm in hollywood trynna get
A couple mil and I just got a call that my dawg got killed
And maybe it wouldn't have happened if I wouldn't have been
Out here but and still even back when dub had a job cuttin'
Steel even back when we was on the block up the hill up
Hundred thirty first there was blood gettin' spilled
I ain't re-invent the wheel mothafucka
This is how it is where I live mothafucka
Semis and blue nose pit mothafucka
Just in case they run up in the crib mothafucka
Got kids mothafucka
Fuck you think you knew about me?
Got a question? I don't even want to talk to you ask them
They the ones that grew up around me
Kept it 100 percent same crew till the end, kells

It's deeper than that you know what I mean
In so many years and all the shit we been through
That's definitely my brother
I do for him, he do for me
And it was always like that ay shit changes
Same mothafucka we grew up with we're still boys
He never really been for the bullshit he's one hunned

Imma need about an hour
And a first class ticket wait
Make that a jet and a champagne shower
Oh I ain't rich yet
Fuck it I can make a dollar inna dream, work
I was on the cover of double XL I ain't talkin' 'bout the big T-shirt
Lace up I'm finna run circles 'round squares in these nike airs
Finna go hard with my dawgs that were right there
Finna treat songs like a mothafuckin' pal
And flip an empty house to a mothafuckin crowd
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout yes sir
Errbody better pay respect yes sir
I be in the land with a steel tecsture
I object and a ways that they test first
Bitch I'm from the east side, east side
Watch first 48 I owe nobody just know I rep, rep OH, get it?
Fuck it if you don't I'm just ventin' like I use to do like these
Rappers I will never mention how stupid are you to think I would
Give you my attention when you nothin' but a peasant and
I am a fuckin' legend can you feel that?

Once we got our highschool they were teachin' shit
So we would just go do whatever get some money do whatever
We was always scared of kickin it though
Kids would want to battle and shit you know what I mean
Like he said he wanted to rap so he would push into random
Battle at school you know what I mean
I just knew one of us would make it in something you
Know what I mean and I just felt that
