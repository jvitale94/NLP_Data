You got a money maker then make some
Nah, I ain’t feelin’ hate
Skinny, white, black, no discriminate
Yea, everybody is included
Hell yea, we can do this
Show me what you got, what your mamma gave you
Make that pussy pop, put it on the table
Just like that, do it like you do it when you lookin’ in the mirror
You know, when you’re home alone
Practicin’ before daddy get there
And I’m on my way, I mean I work all day
You know I’m tryna get laid
Chop the tree then I pop the pop and I’mma act a fool when I’m in that thang
But first thing’s first
MOE, yes over everything
Got cash on my head 
I’m after the bread like they ain’t gon never change
But when I’m done, countin’ up, we could have some fun
Wut? I got a thousand of ones
Bust it over to me like you tryna get 

Paid paid paid paid
And when I get drunk hold up, we could both get laid laid laid laid
But the work come first and the work might take all day day day day
Put your back into it when you shake shake shake shake
Do it for me do it for me like you tryna get paid paid paid paid
And when I get down hold up, we could both get laid laid laid laid
But the work come first and the work might take all day day day day
Put your back into it when you shake shake shake shake
Do it for me do it for me like you tryna get paid paid paid paid

Now it look like you can ride this head like a bicycle
Highschool? Not that type of dude
You are good then we halla all night with you oh how I’ve changed
Up my game, bad bitch say she don’t fuck with lames
I don’t know what you’re seein’ but you should not believe it
I’mma cover of a book, you should read for a change
Yea, suck my worm silly little rabbit then struck my nerves
Hoes stay schemin’ but so do I
I might fuck you then fuck with her
What’s your plan? What’s your plan?
You don’t give a damn? Do your dance
Cuz I don’t give a damn, I’m cool with no fan
I don’t think you understand
You lookin’ at a nigga that’s tryna get

Paid paid paid paid
And when I get drunk hold up, we could both get laid laid laid laid
But the work come first and the work might take all day day day day
Put your back into it when you shake shake shake shake
Do it for me do it for me like you tryna get paid paid paid paid
And when I get down hold up, we could both get laid laid laid laid
But the work come first and the work might take all day day day day
Put your back into it when you shake shake shake shake
Do it for me do it for me like you tryna get paid paid paid paid

Everything green which means everything goes
Hard was the path I took, yea took it to the marble floor
Beat it and I leave it where it’s at? No
It means you and I get to attach you
Already know I ain’t fuckin’ with that and if you didn’t know
I’m just fuckin’ with that like I be lovin’ the cat
It’s not in my nature but we could do it like momentarily dature
Besides, you don’t want none to do with this
You only want the film and I’m using this
Key in ignition, reverse in drive
Open doors, I let you ride
I let you drive until the gas gone
But when the cash call, I’m flaggin’ whole
I gotta go now, see you later
Uuuh that ass so fat, I’mma see you later
I’ll be back one day but don’t ask cuz I can’t say
I wish I could stay but if I should stay
Then how in the hell would a nigga ever get

Paid paid paid paid
And when I get drunk hold up, we could both get laid laid laid laid
But the work come first and the work might take all day day day day
Put your back into it when you shake shake shake shake
Do it for me do it for me like you tryna get paid paid paid paid
And when I get down hold up, we could both get laid laid laid laid
But the work come first and the work might take all day day day day
Put your back into it when you shake shake shake shake
Do it for me do it for me like you tryna get paid paid paid paid
