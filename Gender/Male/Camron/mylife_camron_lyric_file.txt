I don't give a fuck if he fourteen-years-old or not
Nah-nah-nah, you can't let that shit slide
Ay, aiyyo Donnie, C'MERE!


Yo, I went to the block manicured, seen my worker, approached him
Told 'em, "Look, I'm not a big fan of yours; you fuckin up money"
He said, "You s'posed to me the man and all!"
I told the nigga, "Damn the torch! Fuck about a damn award
It's all about the principle; look, I ain't tryna be your principal
but I ain't dumb and you, ain't invincible"
Niggaz talk subliminal, then grab they genitals
I don't play that shit, a different individual
You got me thinkin criminal (word!), he said "I'm only a soldier"
Well good, pay a general
Over a small thing, but let small thing slide
...You be a poor thing, then I heard


My life, my life, my life, my life, duckin one-time
If you whippin the white, you'd be what I be (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-oooooh)
If you whippin the white, you'd be what I be (la-da-la-da-laaaaah)


See I'm envied by most of you so I don't get close to you
Still be on Lennox, fuck am I supposed to do?!
When Tito fire escape - Grey Goose, Mimosa too
Next morning take a flight straight to my ocean view
(I swear) By the sea and beach, from my room
you can see the beach, Gucci linen, see the sheets, green and peach
Chandeliers out your reach, smokin that Chong and Cheech
Two girls in thongs, Dawn and Keish', off the leash
(Shh...) I'm tryin my best to be discrete
(Shh...) I'm tryin my best to leave the streets (I am!)
But I got some hungry niggaz and they need to eat
Oh shit! You see the chief?! (There he go!)


My life, my life, my life, my life, duckin one-time (If you whippin out that white)
If you whippin the white, you'd be what I be (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-oooooh)
If you whippin the white, you'd be what I be (You would think I'm a professional)
If you whippin the white, you'd be what I be (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-oooooh)
If you whippin the white, you'd be what I be (Take my time, whip that white)
My life, my life, my life, my life, duckin one-time (If you whippin out that white)
If you whippin the white, you'd be what I be (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-oooooh)
If you whippin the white, you'd be what I be (You would think I'm a professional)
If you whippin the white, you'd be what I be
If you whippin the white, you'd be what I be (Take my time, whip that white)
My life, my life, my life, my life, duckin one-time
