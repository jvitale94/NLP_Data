Let's do it y'all,


Now lord you know,
Just how hard I try to live my life & live it right all the time, (Nasty)
'Till i see some light, (Dipset, we here let's do it man)
Or even better,
Way over way a new day, (Long time man)
Someday ?? something about tomarrow,(Harlem)
It gets better you know, (Killa, Killa)


Uh,
Listen,
On my muscle you'll be dazzled,
But hustlins a hassle,
Percuset, demerol, capsules & packets,
Cops want to cuff you,
Niggas want to clap you,
Bitches want to burn you,
They running with that clap too,
But the monster made it,
Do it for those incarcerated,
Who had it confiscated,
I hate it when they take powder,
Upstate he takes showers,
Baby mom on Greyhound for eight hours,
See a man face to face through a glass,
On the phone,
10 years he got chasin' that cash,
Cocaine he had to gave in the stash,
Fell like the towers when the planes went on crash,
It wasn't nine one one (9/11)
But it was nine one one (9-1-1)
Gave him nine plus one,
Dropped a dime on dun,
I told him get his nine & run,
Turned him self in i had to find that dumb, (thats too long)


Now lord you know,
Just how hard i try to live my life & live it right, (Dipset bitch, Dipset bitch)
'Till i see some light, (Killa, Killa)
Or better yet,
Way over way a new day,
Someday its the ? something about tomorrow,(Florida y'all wit me)
It gets better you know,(Uh,Killa)


Ayyo,
Them niggas from the three two,
Said i can't breeze through,
The fourty if I cop bottles,
We can't believe you,
Me who?,
Please boo,
Landin' in that G2,
The same color as beef stew,
Favin' that is GQ,
That's me true,
Peace Blue,
Hebrew,
Lawyer on my side to keep me out of jail the fee stoop,
That's deep, (wooh)
But it might lead to that R2-D2,
The mobsters creep through,
We the new P.E.,
Shit P.U.,
To the hood,
Ya'll don't need me,
I need you,
Because my missions the same,
You couldn't envision the pain,
Always a snitch in the game,
What you want prison or fame,
Neither one dun,
As long as my digits the same,
He lookin' frigid,
Dig it,
Make sure them digits get changed,
(Why?)
Because I can't be in hell's cell,
Shouts to mel mel,
Cash & Heoll Rell,
Zeke doing 3,
He even fell hell,
He coming home in '07,
Owns 12 cells,
Because you must of known,
I can't trust the phones,
For the dough you'll be like d'oh stuck at home,


Now lord you know, (Lord you know)
Just how hard I try to live my life & live it right all the time,
'Till I see some light,
Or better yet,
Way over Way a new day, (Wayyyyy)
Someday its the ? something about tomorrow,
It gets better you know,


Uh,
Yo,
Now a days dog they raid up in the ball parks,
Blaze up when they cross sharks,
We raiders of the lost arcs,
I'm like the ball player,
Shake up & cross narcs,
They get mad when I lay up in the Porsche Box,
More props,
R.I.P. my poor pops,
Can't see his sun shine like the four tops,
My antennas will block the scanners,
I got blammers,
You'll drop your hammers,
Lawyers to watch grammar,
Cameras to watch Cameras,
Niggas to watch bitches,
Nanna to watch Grandma,
In pajamas,
I snook out to watch santa,
Now look at Killa,
You gon' watch Santana,
