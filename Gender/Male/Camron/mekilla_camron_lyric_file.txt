Drug dealer, skanless nigga
'Less nigga, 'less nigga
Come again, me say me


Yo, I don't know what you heard, but I'm cool with the drama
Couple people still alive cause I'm cool with their mama
Niggas thinking I'm with JuJu cause I'm in love
She ain't black, man, she Cuban, I'm over the plug
I can make cocaine
Crack too, baking soda, propane
No halves or quarters, I do the whole thing
Take a sniff you'll be on that soulplane, oh mane
Money makers linked up because we feel each ther
Last name Giles, but run it like the Felix brothers
Wanna bet? Then let's deal, it gets real
Over that juice I play Bishop and press steel




Yo, any beef, man, I muzzle it, go
In the middle of the summer I be shoveling snow
What fight? What fight you had? Man, you tussle with hoes
Before I met Terrence Howard, Cam hustled and flowed
Be in meetings in my pajamas
Turn decimals into commas
You get it like I get it then meet me in the Bahamas
Island, in Nassau I'm building a Benihanas
Still in the hood, though waiting on any drama
Or the projects parked waiting on your mama
Or the park in the projects to bating with piranhas
Call this an Apartheid, baby, I'm from the far side
Trafficking, nah, it's just a car ride
