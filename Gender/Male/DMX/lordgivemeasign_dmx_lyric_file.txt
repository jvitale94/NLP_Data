In the name of Jesus
(that's right)
No weapon formed against me shall prosper
(preach)
And every tongue that shall rise against me in judgment thou shalt condemn
(preach)
(Lord give me a sign)
For this is the heritage of the servants of the Lord
(preach)
and their righteousness is of me, saith the Lord.
(preach)
Amen


Lord Give me a Sign!
I really need to talk to you Lord
Since the last time we talked the walk has been hard
Now I know you haven't left me
But I feel like I'm alone
I'm a big boy now but I'm still not grown
And I'm still going through it
Pain and the hurt
Soaking up trouble like rain in the dirt
And I know!
Only I can stop the rain
Wit just the mention of my saviors name
IN THE NAME OF JESUS!
Devil I rebuke you for what I go through
And trying make me do what I used to
But all that stops right here
As long as the Lords in my life I will have no fear
I will know no pain from the light to the dark
I will show no shame spit it right from the heart
Cause its right from the start
But you held me down
And ain't nothing they can tell me now
Lord give me a sign!


Let me know whats on your mind
Let me know what I'm gone find
It's all in time
Show me how to teach the mind
Show me how to reach the blind
Lord give me a sign!

Show me what I got to do
To bring me closer to you
Cause I'm gonna go through
What ever you want me to
Just let me know what to do
Lord give me a sign!


Please show me something
I'm tired of talking to him
Knowing he fronting
Crying bout life ain't nothing
But you either be the one mad cause you trapped, or the one hunting
Trapped in your own mind waiting on the Lord
Or hunting wit the word that cuts like a sword
The spoken word is stronger than the strongest man
Carries the whole world like the strongest hand
Through the trials and tribulations you never let us down
JESUS!
I know your here with us now
JESUS!
I know your still wit us now
Keep it real wit us now
I wanna feel show me how
Let me take your hand, guide me
Ill walk slow but stay right beside me
Devil's tryna find me
Hide me, hold up I take that back
Protect me and give me the strength to fight back!


Let me know whats on your mind
Let me know what I'm gone find
It's all in time
Show me how to teach the mind
Show me how to reach the blind
Lord give me a sign!

Show me what I got to do
To bring me closer to you
Cause I'm gonna go through
What ever you want me to
Just let me know what to do
Lord give me a sign!


Life or death
Live or die
I will never live a lie
I'm going there cause I try
I wont quit until I die
I'm gone make it wrong or right
Make it through the darkest night
When the morning comes you'll see
All I have is God in me
(Lord give me a sign!)


No weapon formed against me shall prosper
For this is the heritage of the servants of the Lord
In the name of Jesus
Lord give me a sign
Amen
