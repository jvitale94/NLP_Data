I got them things that will get you going nigger
When it's on nigga, they call a backfire
The air nigga south, it's like a flat tire
We some grown men with some close shit
With something thats best to leave the fuck a lone shit
We get it all quick, you know what type of shit this is
Cause we ain't getting crunk cuz we don't leave no witnesses
Fuck you to the judge fuck you to the police,
Fuck a snitch in the fucking ass with no grease
We don't want no peace, war till we die
And we gon get it in till we fall and fly
Get your money up, get your paper right
Get your money up, get your paper right

Or watch these niggas do their things for real, alright?

Or watch these niggas do their things for real, alright?

Back on the grind, back on the clock,
Coming back for mine, back on the block
The killers are back with the glock, stick niggas up
Hear that meat wagon,come and pick niggas up

Or watch these niggas do their things for real, alright?
