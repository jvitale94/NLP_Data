Never been a sucker for love
So if it come down to you and me you know
I don’t give a fuck, hit the next bitch like wassup
cause at the end of the day
you ain’t never been nothing but a nut
I ain’t never been a sucker for love
so if it come down to you and me you know
I don’t give a fuck, hit the next bitch like wassup
cause at the end of the day
you ain’t never been nothing but a nut


Listen boo, you’s a bitch, you been a bitch
you know how niggas do
run up in a bitch, fuck her well
and the bitch will call them bitches
but then in a week or 2, fucking all them bitches
A nigga gotta fall back and take a breather
shawty suck a mean dick but in the morning
gotta leave her, wasn't trying to deceive her
I just wanted my dick suck
cute as a motherfucker
and she got a big butt

cause she’s acting like she ain’t trying go nowhere
ain't really trying to get attached to this shit

oh you think it’s like that, ok! I’ll be right back

I don’t give a fuck, hit the next bitch like wassup
cause at the end of the day
you ain’t never been nothing but a nut
I ain’t never been a sucker for love
so if it come down to you and me you know
I don’t give a fuck, hit the next bitch like wassup
cause at the end of the day

It was summer time, I was in the slumps
seen that bitch from a far, I was like wassup
remember me? I was that kid
it was him and me, you just did what you did
how you expect me to respect you
when I know a police file of other niggas that you gave your sex to
i ain’t never been a sucker so if you think so
you got the wrong motherfucker
what’s my name? ah ah, bitch! what’s my name?
you know who the fuck it is
I’m a real nigga, that’s about my biz




I like the way you beat head, oooh, that's that street shhh
Shawty can you keep a secret?
Look here, you know what I’m trying to creep with
Ok, come on, cars outside, hotels up the block
Jump in the ride, you and me for the rest of the night
It’s all good, click, turn off the lights
Pack it off like that girl, ooh, damn, that ass fat girl
We almost there baby, oh shit yeah baby, ow!
