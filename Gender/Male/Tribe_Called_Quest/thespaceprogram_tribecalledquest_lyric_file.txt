The heat, the heat, the heat, the heatâ€¦
It's comin' down hard
We've got to get our shit together)
It's time to go left and not right
Gotta get it together forever
Gotta get it together for brothers
Gotta get it together for sisters
For mothers and fathers and dead niggas
For non-conformers, won't hear the quitters
For Tyson types and Che figures
Let's get it together, come on, let's make it
Gotta make it to make it to make it to make it
To make something happen, to make something happen
To make something happen, let's make something happen

Word to Phife, we're gonna bring it to the overlord
Drinkin' Sisqo chilling with the gold microphone cords
And we grip our balls every time we stuntin' on tour
'Cause we never bored, respond until the ready crowds roar
And promoters try to hit us with the art of war
We about our business, we not quitters, not bullshitters, we deliver
We go-getters, don't be bitter 'cause we not just niggas

Jarobi might fire off into different cloth
Ain't nothing forbidden  is hittin' off
Hardest spitting, this sit-in will make you kitten-soft
Confused and amazed  ya brain, lost our planet for our future people
None of our people involved
Pouring Henny and Smirnoff to get it cracking off
Cracking off a Smirnoff to quickly turn to Molotov
Molotov the spaceship though before that bitch is taking off
It always seems the poorest persons are people forsaken, dawg
No Washingtons, Jeffersons, Jacksons on the captain's log
They'd rather lead us to the grave, water poisoned, deadly smog
Mass un-blackening, it's happening, you feel it y'all?
They'd rather see we in a three-by-three structure with many bars
Leave us where we are so they can play among the stars
We're taking off to Mars, got the space vessels overflowing
What, you think they want us there? All us niggas not going

Reputation ain't glowing, reparations ain't flowing
If you find yourself stuck in the quick, you better start rowing
Used to see the TV screen as the place I'd land my dream
And the car stereo where they would promote the show
Optimistic flow, brother really know

There ain't a space program for niggas
Yeah, you stuck here, nigga
There ain't a space program for niggas
Yeah, you stuck here nigga
There ain't a space program for niggas
Yeah, you stuck here, nigga
There ain't a space program for niggas
Yeah, you stuck, stuck, stuck

Sit and wonder sometimes, I read the paper every day
All these happenings is circular, just happen different ways
And the present is refined, in her wings she's confined
With about thirty Percocets and five bottles of wine
Caroline ain't nothing finer than a Black woman who climbs
To the top of the State building claiming that the flag is mine
Now, people on top of people, feels like we can't breathe
Put so much in this muthafucka, feel like we should lead
Put it on TV, put it in movies, put it in our face
These notions and ideas and citizens live in this age
I chuckle just like all of y'all, absurdity, after all
Takes money to get it running and money for trees to fall
Imagine for a second all the people are colored, please
Imagine for a second all the people in poverty
No matter the skin tone, culture or time zone
Think the ones who got it would even think to throw you a bone?
Move you out your neighbourhood, did they find you a home?
Not safer, probly no place to
Imagine if this shit was really talkin' about space, dude
Imagine if this shit was really talkin' about space, dude
Imagine if this shit was really talkin' about space, dude

Tryna go left and not right
Gotta get it together forever
Gotta get it together for brothers
Gotta get it together for sisters
For mothers and fathers and dead niggas
For non-conformers, won't hear the quitters
For Tyson types and Che figures
Let's make somethin' happen, let's make somethin' happen
Let's make somethin' happen, let's make somethin' happen
Gotta get it together for brothers
Gotta get it together for sisters
For mothers and fathers and dead niggas
For non-conformers, won't hear the quitters
For Tyson types and Che figures
Make, make, make
Let's make somethin' happen, let's make somethin' happen
Let's make somethin' happen, let's make somethin' happen
Gotta get it together forever
Gotta get it together for brothers
Gotta get it together for sisters
For mothers and fathers and dead niggas
For non-conformers, won't hear the quitters
For Tyson types and Che figures
Let's make somethin' happen, let's make somethin' happen
Gotta get it together for brothers
Gotta get it together for sisters
For mothers and fathers and dead niggas
For non-conformers, won't hear the quitters
For Tyson types and Che figures
Make, make, make
Let's make somethin' happen, let's make somethin' happen
Let's make somethin' happen, let's make somethin' happen
Gotta get it together forever
Gotta get it together for brothers
Gotta get it together for sisters
For mothers and fathers and dead niggas
For non-conformers, won't hear the quitters
For Tyson types and Che figures
Let's make somethin' happen, let's make somethin' happen
Gotta get it together for brothers
Gotta get it together for sisters
For mothers and fathers and dead niggas
For non-conformers, won't hear the quitters
For Tyson types and Che figures
Make, make, make
Let's make somethin' happen, let's make somethin' happen
Let's make somethin' happen, let's make somethin' happen

The danger must be growing, for the rowers keep on rowing
And they're certainly not showing any signs that they are slowing!
We're there
Where?
Here
A small step for mankind
But a giant step for us
Oompa, loompa, doopa dee doo
I've got another puzzle for you
