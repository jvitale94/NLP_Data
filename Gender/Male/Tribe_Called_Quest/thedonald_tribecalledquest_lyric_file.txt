Nuff ting, that's why me had to come through
Phife Dawg, you spit wicked every verse
The north said respect the Trini man first
Phife Dawg, I know you had the man shook up
Good shit 'cause you a mastermind that cook up
Phife Dawg, whatagwan with the crew?
Nuff ting, that's why me had to come through
Phife Dawg, you spit wicked every verse
Them north said respect Trini man first
Phife Dawg, I know you honor wha nem choose
Give me that 
Phife Dawg, I know you don't wanna choose
Give me a zugu zugu and do exactly what you do
Tribe Called Quest, you see them back with one another
Ayo, Busta Bust, them not want no problem, brother


Phife Dawg legend, you can call me Don Juice
I'm the shit right now, what, you need to see proof?
Recently on the internet they chatting
Taking polls, debating who could win in battle rapping
Let's make it happen, these cyber thugs already par
No subliminals with me, you know who the fuck you are
Who wanna spar? ha ha, well, here I are
Unorthodox spitter orbing on the southpaw
No doubt, I'mma set it, dudes best be ready
Off top on the spot, no reading from your Blackberry
Leave the iPhones home, skill sets must be shown
I'mma show you the real meaning of the danger zone
I got its own, eights fit to all clones
Untouchable in my zone, watch the tone, leave em alone
Fuck your ass-cheek flows with bars sweeter than scones
Put down microphone


Yes, yes, he the wrong ones to fuck with
No matter what the day he could catch you on his plane
Or the one you on today
Visit niggas in their dreams, make them scream of bloody murder
He's a Trini gladiator, ain't no need to take it further
If you wanna take it further your huckleberry is here
Doctor of your holiday, wire up the computers like your kids
We gon' celebreate 'em, elevate 'em, father had to levitate 'em
Give 'em reason, don't debate 'em, top to bottom, the way to raid 'em
