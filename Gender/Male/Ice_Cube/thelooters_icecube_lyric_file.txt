But you just can't run up in this building and shoot
And fools got my brother hostage, man
 
 Fuck that!!
 

I don't want nobody shoots 'til I say so, you understand?
I'm running this crew
 

And you ain't running shit but your mouth
Cause shit ain't worked all day and it's on
 

Ugh, YOU GONNA GET YOURS!! -> 
Ugh, YOU GONNA GET YOURS!! -> 
 

Five niggaz on the roof with the proof
And one went out
White boy wanna know what it's all about
Back in St. Louis
Down with King James so everybody knew us
Who that wanna do us? - GOOSE!!
The first motherfucker done went loose
Catch him on the roof, got my news from my Deuce Deuce
Savon, can't be clowned
 

Saw the motherfucker got the critical beat down
On and on the drama continues to ring
For me, I'm known as James the King
I got a partner by my right hand
Though Savon is the hype man
But he thinks that he can do something I can't do
"What's that?" - command the crew
Now, I'm finding out who was really true
Two white boys got my brother on a hostage's tip
 

Fuck that, I wanna give them full clips
So you better stay calm with the shooters
Ugh, and here come the looters
 

Move it
YOU GONNA GET YOURS!! -> 
Move it
YOU GONNA GET YOURS!! -> 
 

Ugh, bailed through the skylight
He spends some time, so could you give me a highlight
White boy got to stick his nose in, claimed he seen nothing
Got to break him off something
Rushed down the steps, hands up, sound dumb
Shaking like a bitch is how we found him
Showed him the Machete, he stepped back from the riot
Claimed he ain't never seen a nigga like that
With Don and Cletus, we stepped about seven for two 
And I'm the meanest motherfucker in my crew
Do him, boom, hit another shot
Ran for cover 
 

Awww shit, got my little brother
I'm not nice tonight, cause you got me in a Gun Fight
Yeah, the cap peeler, big drug dealer
I already had to kill the man
Called up Raymond who is crazy as I am
He got the ammo', he got much guns
Trunk the funk, now, my posse is ready to pump the chumps
I wanna kill them suckers badder than any of them
Let them showed me my brother's health
Savon, don't care, he is my nightmare
I'm trying to slow him up
 

I wanna blow them up
So you better stay calm with the shooters
Motherfucker
 

YOU GONNA GET YOURS!! -> 
Move it
YOU GONNA GET YOURS!! -> 
Move it
 

Pour more juice to the scene
Cause Raymond got a trunk full of M16s
Now, bitch give me room
He got Wickey, K.J. and Luther and White Moon 
Cletus and Savon 
Seven motherfuckers that drag like Ping Pong
 

There's a lot of bullets flying
Echoes screeching, there's a lot of motherfuckers dying
All I want is my brother back
13 men in the St. Louis death track
 

So you better stay calm with the shooters
The shooters, the shooters, the motherfucking looters
 

YOU GONNA GET YOURS!! -> 
Move it
YOU GONNA GET YOURS!! -> 
Move it
YOU GONNA GET YOURS!! -> 
Move it
