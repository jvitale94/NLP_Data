I'm still livin like a dope dealer
And these streets they got no mercy on a broke nigga
Gangsta Island so all my niggas gang bangers
Girls come get your cook up
I came up with the cane slangers
And I grew up next door to the dopeman
Chevy red CL coupe clean as a coke can
DEA been doing surveillance they in the dope van
Nowadays they pay Walter Payton that's 34 bands
Yea, I'm still living like a jack boy
Got your family wrapped up in tape, I'm 'bout the sack boy
And I heard it ain't where you from it's where you at boy
Make sure every place that I'm at next to the strap boy
Killing em, shit from these verses put holes in hearses
And these truckers need some product to purchase some at their service
Used to sale my yellow and nextel play for the chirpers
Ain't no doubt we don't check out CTE they close the curtains


And I'm still, still livin like a dope dealer
Finger on the trigger I ain't taking shit from no nigga
Still, I'm still living like a dope boy
Wrapping up the pack of drugs traffic what you know boy
And I'm still, still livin like a dope dealer
Finger on the trigger I ain't taking shit from no nigga
Still, I'm still living like a dope boy
Wrapping up the pack of drugs traffic what you know boy


Still cashing at dope check
Guns a contraband know that
Street said that I marked for death
And might be the one to give smoking next
Might fuck around might beat it down
That ass round and that throat wet
You a pussy boy straight cold Tecs
Got a hundred rounds bitch hold that
Bitch hold that, bitch hold up
Bitch know what that 4 bust
Bought a 14 of that straight hard
And served every geeker that rolled up
That straight trap with no raps with me
OT but they pack with me
Moonwalking on dope bitch I know real niggas on Jackson street
25th, 49th, cali kush over night
Come back to my store dawg to make sure you got your order right
And my shop might close up so make sure you put your orders in
Just another day another dollar ducking court again
Wrapping up the pack of drugs traffic watching out
Winter summer spring fall nigga shovel snow
And if I could I'd dig a tunnel straight to Mexico
Pass me my strap I think the police at my door because I'm
