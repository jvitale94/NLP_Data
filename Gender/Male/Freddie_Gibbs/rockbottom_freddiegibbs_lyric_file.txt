I'm a get up on a muthafuckin sack and a big ass bottle to solve all my problems
I'm goin in circles man, goin in circles man
Sometimes I feel like feel like I'm goin in circles man 


Damn, if you man put some muthafuckin food on the table
That's what she said but still a nigga wasn't able to get up some
Bread for the rent, lights, and cable, the gas and water
She actin like I'm tryna starve her and I know the baby growin
And her belly gotta eat too only thing I got left is this gun on my belt
If I can't feed myself how I'm a feed you how I'm a ride with this tank on empty
Sellin yola hopin that the jakes don't get me cause when I leave the crib
Man that thang go with me my nigga from the jets got stained for a
50... sack of the hard tryna match you a broad gotem shot up in his car
By a muthafuckin dope fiend a bitch tryna get a fix put my nigga in a ditch
We been hittin dem licks since we was 14
Now they say you inna calmer place I could'nttell
By the looks on yo momma face
Now everytime she look at me I see a look of disgrace
She disappointed by the dreams we was lookin to chase

Cause we was cookin the base and we was flippin the spinach
And if a nigga violated then we handled our business
We neva knew one day the street shit a catch up with us
And I don't roll with many niggas you was one of the realest I'm like


Damn, it can't get no worse then this cause I done hit rock bottom
I'm a get up on a muthafuckin sack and a big ass bottle to solve all my problems
I'm goin in circles man, goin in circles man
Sometimes I feel like feel like I'm goin in circles man 


Damn, open my mailbox and all I get to see is bill after bill
Shit kinda slow ain't no real money been comin in but yo I still got ten on the kill
Ten on the drank, a nigga be on ten when I'm sober to get me over keep me full of the poison
My nigga rich doin a bid they sent the boys in to getem if woulda been witem I woulda joined him
And now I'm out here lurkin the streets with no work feelin like my throat been cut with no plug
You know just what I mean if you eva done sold drugs finna rob me a nigga cause I ain't got no love
And I ain't got no qualification for no career move people up in corporate america probly fear dude
