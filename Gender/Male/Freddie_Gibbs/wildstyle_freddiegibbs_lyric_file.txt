Wild style, wild style
Is the return of the wild style, just  
Is the return

I'm on a spiritual high smoke that lyrical lie,
My cutties keep that vanilla shit in the sky
Even if it's laced, I roll piff to get by,
The burner in your face means you got some shit in your eye
I fire shots put your ass in a quiet box
And when the riot stops I'm the one firing cops
I smoke Phillies I can kill an entire box
I'm the Gorilla killer you on ya mozilla firefox
Try and bark, I'll put you down on dead dogsâ€š cause I'm a shark
Really to you I'm Reinhart,
I run over ya head, leaving your face with tire marks, put a grenade in your mouth
And blow your life apart,
And any mission I embark has a violent start,
Bloody ending is so depending if the knife is sharp,
This is psycho talk my blades lipo-sharp, I'm down to fight a whole block, fuck the cops!


Is the return of the wild style, wild style
Just  
Wild style, wild style
Is the return of the wild style, just  
Is the return

All I do is write verses and wrap up rubberbands
Roll a'84 and roll up a Wood with my other hand
And I fuck with felons don't fuck with the F.E.D.s
They know I'm selling something ain't nobody selling cd's
Another trick up my sleeve, but another bitch that I'm sticking
I introduce to the sniffing and dick in different positions
Got introduced to some friends and sit back as if I was flipping
She sniffing that shit in daily, your daughter need interventions!
That's some cold shit! Fred, you musta be smoking water when you wrote this
Nah I'm in Brooklyn, back from Gary fresh off a dope flip
Do the speed limit pay attention and never smoke shit
Call up Dominican H and told him I was posted!
Baby face gangsta stay with 3 bangers
Heat the microwave and cut up them cookies like Famous Amos
Shit get rectified by sticking this dope in a bitch's anus
 shoot that to my brother let's get this paper bitch!



Flow superior to others often than I'm fell
Freddie and fred feel like I'm talking to myself
Far as rhymes I'm awesome, the metaphors I own want they own line in a auction
Caution niggas I'm often, no discussion,  take care of the coughin, robatussin.
Selectah  I ain't really got beef I'm just kind of collector
Is the return of the wild style ice in the quarter rock back to the vials now
They one dimensional I got styles now, tomorrows best lyrics is my freestyles now
I respect you when you when you spit shit, you far from nice you need jet blue to get there

My terminology but I
