Rap game, rap game easy than a motherfucker
Diamonds on my motherfuckin' neck and wrist
You see this shit is breezy than a motherfucker
I get broke than a bitch
Put my feet all in the dope game
Chillin' in my granny basement
Probably dreamin' 'bout some cocaine

On the phone cussin' out my baby mama
She hate it cause I hang out with the killers and the robbers
Got a house in California and I flooded it with choppers
Met my plug and got a duffle bag of dope at Benihana
Taught my youngin's how to wrap it up and pack and do it proper
Took 'em shoppin' got the car squattin' down on Forgiatos
You ain't fuckin' you a friendzone nigga, you a Roger
Freddie Kane still hang with the killers and the robbers
Thirty shots in the FN, fuck nigga
Why you got a chopper and you scared to bust, nigga?
Some nigga tried to kill me, man that's all I trust, nigga
But my momma raised a drug dealer, not a fuck nigga
I just, I just a hit a nigga at the mutherfuckin' brown house
Hit a nigga for a half a brick and lil bow wow
Came in with them motherfuckers they can lay them all down
Hit a nigga for a half a brick and lil bow wow

Dope game, fuck nigga
Why you got a chopper and you scared to bust, nigga?
Some nigga tried to kill me, man that's all I trust, nigga
But my momma raised a drug dealer, not a fuck nigga
I just hit a nick and bought a motherfuckin' car lot
Foreign things, old school, nigga pull them all out
Pull the misses here then blow the motherfuckin' wall out
Foreign things, old school, nigga pull them all out
I'm a pitbull at the stove with the raw, dog
Got her bending corners with the hard and the soft ball
Everyday buy a bag of hard and the soft ball
I just hit them nickles on Dominicans in Naptown
Had em pissed I'm workin' from New York and laid em all down
Got em for some yayo and a brick of lil bow wow
E-S to the G-N man these niggas 'bout to bow down
