You can hang out with the haters or you can hang out with me
Shawty tell 'em if you can't break it down from A to Z
Hey I'm on a little diet gotta stay hater free
You gotta go 


Talking reckless, but I ate that thang for breakfast
And Iâ€™m ready keep on that ring left on my Nikes and my necklace
Ain't no hickies on this sticky, keeping shit secret when we sexing
Go to GI bout my BI rolling in the new 650 flexin
Talking about some top with the top down, what you talk?
Hot sex, champagne all night
You ain't 'bout that life, baby keep on walking
I sweat the weave out
Girl you know the play before we leave out
Cuddle up, double up take them to the suite
Finna show these hoes what this cheese about, Gangsta Gibbs


Maybe she will if she wanna
Maybe she do what she don't
Cause we be on the pimp shit
You gon get your bitch flip, I just wanna hit, get ghost
Shots to the head let's toast, twist up the flame
Pledge allegiance to the realest niggas getting it in this game
Serving things, made my motherfucking name
Gangsta Gibbs




Right back in her, and I ate that thang for dinner
And I Chi-town ride in the summertime, on the West Coast in the winter
Man, I fucking left her fiending, dog, it was so cold how I did her
And she hate my guts but she always gon' be right there when I hit her
Talking about some top on the top floor, what you talking
Hot sex, champagne all night
You about 'bout that life baby keep on walking
I fucks with white girls
Puerto Rican, Asian, I hope you like girls
Got a whole pound and broke some more down
You can get tore down tonight girl
