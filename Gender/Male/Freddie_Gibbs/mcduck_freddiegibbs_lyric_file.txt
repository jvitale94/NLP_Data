Phone blow 4 in the morning
'44 blurtin' till the morning
Then re-up workin in the morning
Used to sell blue beast in the street lights
Now a nigga droppin' 4's on his street side
I got a ghetto bitch been fucking me for three nights
I got her outfit, nails and her weave tight


Diamonds in my piece, that's the G-code
P-89 when I lookin' through the peephole
Cause Tuesday and Thursdays, they in sweep mode
A hundred-round drummer, I ain't gotta reload
I ain't got a, I ain't got a clue, ooh
What the world might do, what the world might do, ooh
I just gotta stay cool, ooh
Lord take me away from here
Lord take me away from here
Lord take me away from here
Lord take me away from here

Hood shit
Platinum in the motherfuckin street nigga, thought you knew this
Fuck a four door, ridin' solo in the new coupe bitch
Leather with the motherfuckin' wood, told the dealer no roof bitch
I told the dealer no roof bitch
They got a nigga like, oh lord
Tell them niggas who they really fuckin with, cause I don't think they know lord
Cause ever since a nigga got a deal been a killer with the flow lord
And if you think I'm lying then I'm flyin', strikin niggas to the floor lord
Throw a young nigga overboard


Diamonds in my piece, that's the G-code
AK when I peep through the peephole
Cause Tuesday and Thursdays, they in sweep mode
A hundred-round drummer, I ain't gotta reload
Diamonds in my piece, that's the G-code
AK when I peep through the peephole
Cause Tuesday and Thursdays, they in sweep mode
A hundred-round drummer, I ain't gotta reload
Lord take me away from here
Lord take me away from here
Lord take me away from here
Lord take me away from here
I ain't got a , I ain't got a clue, ooh
What the world might do, what the world might do, ooh
I just gotta stay cool, ooh
What the world might do, what the world might do, ooh
I just gotta stay cool, ooh


That's what you did
Cause you came out of left field
When I started hearing bout your name
The name had me like you know what I'm sayin' checkin' for this
Then I started hearing you bustin' , I'm hearing you on this song
I heard you on the shit with BJ the Chicago Kid, I heard you on this
Oh, this nigga got flavor!
Nigga didn't know you was from Gary
And that ain't no disrespect
You just sound like you not from nowhere
Yeah, you gotta think about what do a Gary nigga sound like
You ain't ever heard it
So it's like you know, I kinda created that sound
That sound.. yeah I created that sound
Yeah, this is what it gone be
Right, exactly, right
After me, there will be you
Yeah, exactly
