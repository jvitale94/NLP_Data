I keep a pistol on me
I got robbers and jackers and killers on me
How it be when you get to them riches homie
Breaking dope on the desk that's what niggas told me
Breaking dope on the desk that's what niggas told me
Niggas phony, they kill it, it nickel loaded
Middle school with the tool and the pistol loaded
Breaking dope on the desk that's what niggas told me
Breaking dope on the desk that's that nigga Fred
That the king of New York at the Plaza ho
Met some bitches in Vegas at Floyd fight
Beat the pussy down at the Bellagio
Niggas stay on your pimpin', I knock a ho
Niggas stay on your pimpin', I knock a bitch
Nigga I put your bitch on a foreign flight
Have her suckin' some dick on some tropics shit
Everyday a new package, we droppin' shit
Ridin' around with that, ridin' around with that
Ridin' around with that thang
Married to the brick, married to the brick
Gave the bitch my last name
Married to the brick
Freddie Kane about to stamp the bitch with my name
I keep a pistol on me and a brick on the desk that nigga Tony

Was a caine man, now I'mma wrap it and package it up
All my niggas on Glennwood serve it, sackin' it up
Catch a slip and get up
Now I'm finna whip it up
In the bowl gettin' stuck
Hurt my wrist, gettin' stuck
Now I got a whole thang
I just copped a whole thang
Gave it to my little brother
He be rock a whole thang
Cookin' down them whole thangs
Sold the street the whole thang
Got a lot of play, servin' everyday
Got lil homies on the block, still nick 'em down
Workin' package after package, doin' the same thing
Soon I catch a dumb play for a couple bath
Give it to my brother, let him do the same thing, yeah
