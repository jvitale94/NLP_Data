Why you laying down sleeping
I'm a wake you up with it, in the middle of the night
Baby I ain't trying to hold you
I just wanna bend it over, in the middle of the night
(What you wanna do, how you wanna do it)
In the middle of the night
(What you wanna do, how you wanna do it)


What you wanna do, how you wanna do that
... we've been running and do that
Rolling down the pow love the way she move that
Tryin to bend it over you already knew that
Hit you with the dope never been the one who sugar cope
Girl I'm tryin to pope that's the real shit I ever saw
Love you what you wearin' but I'd rather see you naked though
Work it cause I know you're a professional
Shit zip tight, hit me up work I know you want in midnight
I still be up you call my phone you're tryin to get right
You know that pussy so amazin, type a shit that make a nigga chase it
And I'm blowing up the phone in the day time
Tryin to stay away fucking you a face time
But that mean I keep the G you never break mine
I just need a little time, girl you're mine break the spine
In the middle of the night




Uh yeah, lot of shows, lot of freak hoes
In the names in locations can repeat those
And straight cause I can't remember how to lead though
Shame got a pendy but you busy in the sheets though
Baby got a baby but she strictly in the peddy
So people say she crazy but I swear she bitch she with it
Got me cuttin on my own bitch and man I'm talking bout some cold bitch
See you in the act like I don't know bitch face down
Ass up, that's the way you like it
And I ain't try to wife it, but I'm all night it
And bitches at the all star make me all night
I'm tryin the shit they never did I break it all like it
But I rather how you want dick
Every time make commitment know you want that
I'm tryin let you with this gangs and we baby can you fuck with it
I'm a wake you up with it in the middle of the night




The way you wearing laying there naked you
All I can think about is sexing you
I know you gotta go to work
But baby let me go to work
I see you  for your morning
Then you turn all around and you look at me
Oh, you put it on me
