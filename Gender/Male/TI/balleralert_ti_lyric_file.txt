Baller alert, baller alert, baller alert
Baller alert, baller alert, baller alert

Gotta make sure that my chains go with all my clothes
Gotta make sure that my cars matchin' all my clothes
With the 
Quavo Honcho can go places that you can't go
So traditional
Keep the same team, same numbers that's the way it goes
Ain't this what you here for
Now they say they want that Migos flow

Talk about 
Talk about breaking down bricks
Talk about working your speed up
Talk about gasin' your jeep up
Talk about backin' the jeep up
Talk about fallin' then get up
My pockets, they doin' sit ups
I be right back, got a pick up
They say a cheap'll believe her
Baller alert on my beeper
Cappin' is cheaper
Leave it to Beaver
Dabbin' like Cam
Catchin' plays like Brandon
When I'm on the field
Under Armour I'm brandin'


The music is a transference of energy, you dig?
This is right up my alley, like this is me right here
(As soon as it drops like here he go, that's the one)

Flexin' my athleticism
Yeah they ought to show this shit on television
Atlanta Falcon hoodie Balmain
Your girl, she tryna get under my Under Armour
Kick it pimpin', no extra point
Stay imitation, no hesitation
She accept and make it to my celebration
We ballin' hard with no sports agent
We free agent
Least three maybe four
Hit your city, lit everywhere we go
Throw it, I'ma make the catch, incredible
Like Brandon Marshall, coffee colored shawty with me everywhere
Have some  do run it hell yeah
Drippin' sauce all over everything
I'm a real king, you a little son
Boy don't make me pull the rings out the vault
I be showin' off, ain't even got to talk
Shawty let me hit the hole like Marshall Faulk
Or maybe Barry Sanders
Got some cheerleaders, no love handle
Okay
Ain't nothin' really, you better MVP me, Von Miller
Quick as Cam Newton
Superman jukin'
Poppin' champagne at the bowl game
When I told little mama win the whole thing, it ain't no thing
Baby champion is my first name, yeah
