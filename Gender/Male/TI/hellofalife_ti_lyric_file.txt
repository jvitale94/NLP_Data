When people see me on Bankhead man on four star point, screaming, waving and yelling.
I don't wanna roll over no toes in my Rolls.
You just back up let a pimp pass through you dig?

Beamer's, Bently's double R's Ferrari's
Every time I see shorty
Where your head tonight
Selling out arenas chasing asses like Serena
Man, shawty live a hell of a life

Im shining in and out of foreign
Cars never boring
Cash steady flowing they ask shawty where you goin'?
People see me they ask me shawty where you goin'?
Partners see me they ask me shawty where you goin'?

Shorty goin' extra hard when they release his passport
Why I need a credit card what you think this cash for?
Hit the dealership and give them every dime he ask for
Just so I can see 260 on the dash board

If shinnin against the law somebody better get the task force for me
Hoes love me, let me fuck 'em til they ass hoarse
Pimpin' 101 just come and see me take a crash course
You wanna count my money go to college need a math course

On a mad dash for a 100 mill an runnin
Breakneck speed til I see a billi coming.
Im filthy rich and hungry feel the grumbling in my stomach

Im still stunting off the chain chasing nothing but some money
With a couple pair of goons like I'm playing gin rummy
No cards just broads when a nigga dick hard
Flooded offshore automall lookin like a college star
Put it in a wristwatch
Balling like a big shot

Beamer's, Bently's double R's Ferrari's
Every time I see shorty
Where your head tonight
Selling out arenas chasing asses like Serena
Shorty live a hell of a life

I'm shining in and out of foreign
Cars never boring
Cash steady flowing they got shawty where you goin'?
People see me they ask me shawty where you goin'?
Partners see me they ask me shawty where you goin'?

Swag on fully, no semi hoe hear me?
Gimme bankrolls no gimmicks drop Rolls no flemish
Street cred no blemish credit card no limit
You want Bankhead a spot to drop heads I'm in it
Gimme a couple corners hoppin on 20â€™s
With three or four women givin' love like tennis
Got my boxers where her chin is givin me the business
While I ride through the city gag swallow no spitting

Livin' life like I just got out of prison Wednesday night
If a chick in my sight, then that chick getting right
And I know niggas now with bitches think Im hitting and they right
Keep my name out my mouth and mind they business its aight
If you see me say aight ok aight
Cause you know I got the goons with me and I pay aight.
They would like to see me go to prison see me go
But instead they see me balling stunting everywhere we go

Beamer's, Bently's double R's Ferrari's
Every time I see shorty
Where your head tonight
Selling out arenas chasing asses like Serena
Shorty live a hell of a life

I'm shining in and out of foreign
Cars never boring
Cash steady flowing they got shawty where you goin'?
People see me they ask me shawty where you goin'?
Partners see me they ask meshawty where you goin'?
