(say goodbye to the bad guy)


(You don't appreciate a nigga my type,
Once I die there ain't no more niggas my type,
So just remember me right)
Bet you don't appreciate a nigga my type,
But when I die there ain't no more niggas my type,
So just remember me right,
Bet if I let them suckers kill me tonight,
All them haters gonna be filled with delight,
God forgive me aight,
I sacrifice so they can live my life,
If necessary I'll give my life,
What you hear is my life,
Reputation decorated with stripes,
No need crying at the end of my life,
Just remember me right


When your back was against the wall remember where could you go,
Remember who helped you again like he helped you before,
When out his way to let you know that you ain't never alone,
Then disrespect you, you come get who until they left you alone,
He They taught you how to be weak, he thought you how to be strong,
Taught you not to accept defeat you go all out if he gone,
But it ain't the same in the streets now that he gone,
He now in heaven in the thrown exactly were he belong,
Though he left millions devastated and his family mourn,
Sons turn to grown man since their daddy been gone,
Daughters grew like him or not he left his family home,
Even prepared the funeral service he had in the dome,
And then they came to represent for a stand up gent,
Who walked it like he talked it, always said what he meant,
Impossible to stop him had a head like cement,
Maybe now you'll appreciate the nigga like this..


Bet you don't appreciate a nigga my type,
But when I die there ain't no more niggas my type,
So just remember me right,
Bet if I let them suckers kill me tonight,
All them haters gonna be filled with delight,
God forgive me aight,
I sacrifice so they can live my life,
If necessary I'll give my life,
What you hear is my life,
Reputation decorated with stripes,
No need crying at the end of my life,
Just remember me right


If they've only knew the man outside of the hype,
No matter what the situation he alway try to do right,
Still they gossip the told lie, used to take him for granted,
Often found it hard to relate, some how they can't understand it,
'Cause that respect he gonna demand it, there's a problem he handle it,
Looked adversity in the eye, he never ran from a challenge,
They try to knock him off balance when the fed came and got him,
Did the time on the edge came home now he stoppin',
Now while them niggas used to hate him, but they girl use to jock him,
Swear he had the kinda swagger made the world stop and watch him,
Plus he possessed so much hustle, made it impossible to top him,
Got better every album, haters hate to see him drop em',
They just talk shit from a distance, when he around they playin' pose,
He use to scare the suckers shitless, probably why them niggas shot him,
Hey what it took nothing else than what they could've ever did about him,
So go 'head talk shit about him,
At least you ain't forgot about him..




Wanna say sorry to my Mama,
King and Lil Mama,
See me go through so much drama,
You could stand a little thunder,
Never let em' see you sweat, stay cool as a cucumber,
Stay ready for a whatever, make note I'm gonna do wonder,
How he died? On his feet like a man with honor,
Showed you the sky was the limit, you can do whatever you wanna,
and that's for Bubba, Domani, Deja, and Nique Nique,
Don't worry bout me Uncle Phil the ladies with me,
See me with your granddaddy,
I know you gonna miss daddy,
But life ain't always a dream, and horrible shit happens,
Had I let a nigga kill me before I could quit rapping,
An get to spend more time with you, I know we would've been happy,
But I had to take the chances, you would have been trappin',
Long as I could keep that from happening,
Your Papi could die happy,
So keep the wind at your back and the sun at your face,
Remember winnin' in your blood you were born with what it take (OK)..
