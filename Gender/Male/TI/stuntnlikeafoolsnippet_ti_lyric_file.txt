Black rims, white B
8 figure nigga, small digits don't excite me
Iced out brightly, shine like lightning
Everything bad bout my bitches but they hygeine
Turned up hyphy, everytime you see me on
Matter fact, you can't see me
'Less you turn your TV on
Ay, we beyond that peon shit
That he be on
I stunt, ball daily
Fuck y'all, pay me
Rockstar lifestyle, might not make it
My life like a movie
Call me Martin Scorsese
On 5 blazin', burnin' hot cajun
Ay dude, fuck it


Everytime you see me out
Just take yo' ho' and
We be out
We throwin 'bands and goin' HAM, no doubt
You know what we be 'bout


Ballin' out the frame
Stuntin' like a fool

Ay you know how we do
Stuntin' like a fool
