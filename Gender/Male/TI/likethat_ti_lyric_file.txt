That gang bangin rag hangin, what you claimin krunk shit

They want that super gutter ignorant
That new ghetto belligerent
Authentic brick flippin
Dope boy, trap nigga shit
Yeah the like that, they on that
They like that, yeah they want that


They want banana clippin, chicken flippin, pistol grippin, roll out
Music do that shit so good cause thats the shit I know bout
Money over everybody trappin where the goal at
Gimme mine, grind ain't gon' shine til I'm sold out.
Keep a 'k and some yay no hesitation ill spray whoeva in a nigga way.
O's of the haze, only thing a nigga blaze
Gang banga's and j's and projects where a nigga stay.
And my baby mamma sexin in the apartmentttt...?
Okay everybody know me bitch, I'm hot
If you want it, oh I got it
You can fuck with me tonight
Still riding 24's
Pocket fulla chedda now
Get to trappin ill be aight
Soon as I handle my b.i
I'm tryna dodge the fbi
Who knew one day ill be t.i
Chevy sittin real high
Same clothes, still fly
Thats the shit them young niggaz out there wanna hear about




Gangsta walkin
See me approach with caution.
Louie belt around my waistline
Pistol hangin off it
Fuck them niggas who be talkin
They can get it if they want it
Still hangin on the corner slangin crack and marijuana
I'm... still the man in my trap
Disappear from the feds that ran in my trap
Took a half key, hundred grand and my strap
Only thing I got now, this nine in my lap
Better double, triple it, whip it
Get it to sellin get rich or get out the game
Fuck snitches that get to tellin
Magician with a magellan
Already a felon
I ain't even fired up the dro and they already can smell it
Wee hours til the morn' Imma hustle til its all gone
Nigga betta recognize my grind
Bankroll over all 
Nevermind my shine
If ya bangin lemme see ya gang sign one time



Niggas know I spent my whole life in that shit 
They still  around with me 'cause they like that shit 
Yeah they like that (hey) they own that (hey) 
They like that, (hey) yeah they want that 
I used to live it I ain't writin that shit 
Like I'm ridin that shit, that why they like that shit 
Yeah they like that (hey) they own that (hey) 
They like that, (hey) yeah they want that
