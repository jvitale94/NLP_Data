I ain't sign up for this shit. Lost my partner. Lost my life homes. Fuck this shit. I'm done.

A listen homes. Get Atlantic on the phone. Gonna call 'em. Tell Craig, Julie, Cap and Col.
I need to holla at 'em. First I gotta let 'em know I'm tired of rapping. Fuck the money.
Ever since Phil died I ain't happy. A what's happening. We under new operations.
Though we ready, we'd like your cooperation better. Listen when I'm talking. Throwed off.
I ain't patient. I'm gonna tell once then start counting shell cases.
Don't mean to scare but this bullshit is irritating. I'm gonna tell you like it is shawty.
I ain't finna play. I feel another case coming round the corner any day. I know the consequences.

(Listen kid. Understand me here. This is Leor Colin. You better treat this company with some respect.
And you better not be playing wit my motherfucking money.)
I got your motherfucking money partner but I ain't playing. You got any since, you'll do what the fuck I say.
