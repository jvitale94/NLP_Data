Keep your mind, on your grind, and off mine's alright? Right
Hard i'm a ball on them squares i floated
Quarter million dollar cars everywhere I go
I know in the lead it may seem they might be
But no matter what they doin' they don't do it like me
Like a G I hold it down for the town I'm at
And I flash like that recognize I'm back!


Strike a match catch a fire any moment I decide
That's enough of all your lies boy your buzz just died
Step inside super fly to the shoes in they coupe
Then exit out with all the bitches like we always do
My desire to retire grows with every new group
Cause these guys just don't ride like my nigga you too
Tight jeans, funny hair cuts, dancin' on the screen
It's about the real niggas in the game so it seems
Just pretendin' holla pimpin' give this shit a black eye eye
Next he say he trappin' in my head I'm like why
Be yourself, you ain't gotta pimp bone in your body
I can tell ya ain't never bought a key or caught a body
Nigga probably just seen Wayne, Gucci Mane
Me and Boosie all go to prison
Now he flipped his whole image nigga trippin'
Listen, dude, for you that ain't in the cards
Think the power is in the gun, but over all it's in your heart
Nowadays I don't know wassup with niggas in the A
Guess he think he in the game but he really in the way
Violatin', I was having conversations in the joint
With cats who done it and i promised i would put you on point
I'm disappointed in you dog you ain't holdin' it down at all
But I ain't going in your jaw just gon' show ya how to ball
Standin' tall through the storm on the yard or in the dorms
Cats in prison who expectin' me to represent for them




Strike a match catch a fire see T.I add gas
What's a molotov cocktail that never break the glass?
Scary ass nigga wanna come for me you better bring it
I ain't mad I forgive em, God I know they ain't mean it
Yeah I seen it all before, hater pop it and they ain't
Rack they brain try to think how to stop it and they can't
Ain't that lame but then the hatred manifest to pure malice
I'm no longer being callous I'm a let you niggas have it
Won't be satisfied till somebody dies and I'm patient
Waitin' on me and the reaper on a first name basis now
I'm a let you make it now, stay totally out the way for you
But know that we can take it any place you wanna take it to
Hatin' in your blood cuh guess it's just too late for you
All I could do is pray for you or organize a wake for you
Your choice, clearly I ain't hearing your voice
Keep it up and i'm gon' send your ass to deal with aunt joyce
Hey, you can have the bottom partner i'm up in the the sky box
I got shit locked down nigga why stop now
I'm so above you hover over suckers, why drop down?
I'm so profound it goes down and I ...
