I ain't flexin', it just is what it is, pussy nigga
Get thrown, get shot, get killed, pussy nigga
So what? You got all that money but you still a pussy nigga
You ain't bout that life, you just be actin hard, pussy nigga
Every day I'm sucka duckin, trynna dodge pussy niggas
All we did was slang crack and get paid, pussy nigga
Been the man ever since first grade, pussy nigga
Don't believe me? See me, try me, see what happen, pussy nigga
You be dissin',I be laughin' cause you just rappin', pussy nigga
No matter what, you'll never be me, pussy nigga
And see me, no matter what, I'll never be a pussy nigga


I play a lot of games, but I ain't playin', I ain't playin'
They say a lot of things, but they ain't doin' what they sayin'
Don't get it fucked up, them niggas scared not me
Hold up, let me tell these motherfuckers something 'bout me


Hey when they walk up on me 'Man, what it is, my potna?'
I say nuthin' but Bankhead and Center Hill, my potna
Didn't believe us when we said 'They tried to kill my potna.'
That's why he doin' life, but he still my potna
Better get it back to section, you ain't one of my potnas
Get on your ass for touchin', that ain't one of my potnas
Ask Snoop, I'm the truth, like Trae, my potna
C-Dub, KT, yes they my potnas yo
Young Dro, Mac Boney, Big Kuntry, my potnas
They could talk but they know better than to fuck with my potnas
As a young'n OG told me 'Do your thang, my potna!'
That's why now I'm on everything and Hustle Gang, my potna




These niggas talk tough, but they know they don't want it
You see me racked up, it's kinda fucked what you told me
Don't be a fool now, boy I'll leave you where you lay
And I got shooters, ain't no , just what they do every day
Back in the day my record wasn't gettin' played
I was trappin', ridin' dirty, gettin' paid
What? Cut the 5 keys in the back
Hey let me tell you niggas something bout that
My cousin Toot was the man, he got his work 'round the base
And how much money he made, nobody know 'til this day
My uncle quit, had the city sold up
He did 10k and back I blowed up
Ey Every man that's statin' 'bout me
At 16 all I wanted was a key
A bank roll, an apartment full of hoes
Hey let me tell you something 'bout me 'case you didn't know
