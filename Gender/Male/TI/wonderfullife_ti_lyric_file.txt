

One, two, three
Uh yea
Uh oh oh

I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life like

Aye T.I.P. let me holla at you

Making your momma proud, looking in your daughter's eyes
Kicking it with your son, she's tripping, never realize
How good you got it, been so wrapped up in your losses
You couldn't see the profits, could still be in the projects
It's definitely some projects just popping when niggas flopping
Some of you went back to prison, T.I.P. it could've been a coffin'
Now since we talking you've been tripping ever since I died
Appreciate you're missin' me but G, you're still alive
I'm looking down at you, and sending smiles to you
I check the record now, oh tell Tameka hi would you?
Told you she would get you, that's good cause shorty ride with you
Kids getting big, seen king riding a bicycle
Saw Niq-Niq drive a car, see bubble big as you
I see Domani rapping, and he's spittin' too
Lil Deyjah's beautiful, and major super cool
My life is over with ya'll, your life been good to you

And you can tell everybody
This is your song
And you can tell everybody
This is your song

I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life like

Sit down, son
Aye listen to me son, and pay attention to it
Seems like I'm the only one that you'll listen to
I never knew the time that I ain't get to spend with you
Whatever result aye you making yourself miserable
You gotta let it go, it's painful, I already know
The past is the past, just learn from it, grow
So you got Mister with you? And your sister Precious too
I'm proud of you, did better than I expected you to
Although I knew you was special when you was smaller
That's why I was so much harder on you, knew you were smarter
That much come for the offer, I wasn't much of a talker
Great to see you doing better than me, even as a father
Take good care of yo mama, overcoming the drama
Your life is wonderful son, don't let em take it from you
Keep living it to the fullest, treasure it, it's a blessing
Be thankful for all this beauty, when it's over with forget it

And you can tell everybody
This is your song
(This is your song)
And you can tell everybody
This is your song
(Said This is your song)

I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life like

Damn
What up, Phil? So good to hear from you, we're missing you
Remembering all of our conversations, daily reminiscing you
The good the day they low, could tell they don't know who they listen to
Today I watch over Jeanette like she was my own and that could missing you
I swear it's so unfair that I'm right here and you up there
I miss you so much and after the point I call your name but you not there
Now I can't rest and I can't get shit
Off my mind, I'm so upset
It wasn't your time to leave me here
It Broke my heart to see you there
Shot with bullets that were meant for me, families never forgiving me
I knew, but all I could do was follow your memory
But pops I thank you so much for living, I had to grow up
Slinging crack on the corner ain't quite the future you wanted for me
Was it? And this pain I feel it never goes away
Does it? This load I carry get no lighter
I grew up all on my own with a broken heart and a broken home
Taught me everything I've known
Owe you everything I own
I must admit you raised a warrior, my life could be a story book
Hope you proud of me, didn't graduate from college but
Thanks for listening to me,
So long I had this problem dawg
'Til we meet in person let's keep speaking through my verses for life

And you can tell everybody
This is your song
(This is your song)
And you can tell everybody
This is your song
(Said This is your song)

I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life like
