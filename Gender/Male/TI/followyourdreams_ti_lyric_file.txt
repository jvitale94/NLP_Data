Don't ever listen when they tell you you're gonna be a failure
I'm living inside pass the numb
Remember anything's possible believe is all you gotta do
Forever follow your dreams don't give up
Don't ever tell you what you can't do just because they hate you
I'm living inside pass the numb
The sky's the limit, wanted all you gotta do is get it, homie

Message to the youth, remember you can get anything you pursue
Look at me I'm living proof, there's a piece of me you it ain't a lot different about it
Nobody ever told I'd live to see a million dollars
Remember I was hersing just to fix up my parlor
And now you are the scene that kinda rides the hop about them
Convertible Mercedes looking haters like holler
 I don't know you got nada
How they get a second hand is up to their but I'm their fly
So they go hating on ass wife
Oh, never minds, keep your head to the sky, dawg
Remember nothing be suffered you but you try dawg
Don't listen to them when they say you can't have it
Let it go on this year write that down
When Jackie fashion on them laughing,
Soon you'll be passing all their broke asses better than you imagine


Follow your dreams, don't give up
Don't ever listen when they tell you you're gonna be a failure
I'm living inside pass the numb
Remember anything's possible believe is all you gotta do
Forever follow your dreams don't give up
Don't ever tell you what you can't do just because they hate you
I'm living inside pass the numb
The sky's the limit, wanted all you gotta do is get it, homie

Same message on the second could tell you from verse one
You let them trick you out of your dreams - their work's done
Only purpose for some to take your eyes off the prize
And to keep your from succeeding see they're willing to die
Let's say one day you cross paths end up killing the guy
Never make it go to the pen now you let him win
Man now hear he a 
Laughing at you from the grave cause you ain't get paid
Haters same want to call you a sucker today
And laugh at you tomorrow when the fear take you away

Once upon a time there was a guy named Jake
And he would never make a man  he say
He the queer right here today the had day airway
Instead he quit the job plus a hard night and day
Dropped the  artist, though nobody heard of him
Mighty sales but the mixtapes murdered him
Got off the label seen the haters on the inspire
Him determined grand hustle to an empire, and poof
At the hood he blew, if not me JG that could be you, remember


Follow your dreams, don't give up
Don't ever listen when they tell you you're gonna be a failure
I'm living inside pass the numb
Remember anything's possible believe is all you gotta do
Forever follow your dreams don't give up
Don't ever tell you what you can't do just because they hate you
I'm living inside pass the numb
The sky's the limit, wanted all you gotta do is get it, homie
