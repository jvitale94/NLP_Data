You know exactly what a motherfucker need
I need a bag 'bout a hundred fifty Gs
You don't want us to make a motherfucking scene
Check, run it, all hundreds 
Check, run it
No broke shit in my life
Cause I'm scared that shit could rub off on me
I'm superstitious, no lie
Check, run it
No broke shit in my life 

I tell you no lie
I be everywhere you go, guy
Over here every hoe who go by
Say that nigga right there be so fly
Aye doubling up is all I'm about
Man one or two million kept all in the house
I'm calling them shot
Get all of them shots
Hate me till your stomach is all in or not
Boy I'm already hot I'm already rich
You better be gone, you lil' bitty bitch
You petty as shit, I'm real as it get
My nigga Cap hear me say hit 'em with dick
Keep the fuck out your lingo!
They be still invitin' em and calling it swag
None of them niggas you know
Fucking with me, you know it's all in the bag
Check!



I got a big cheque coming with the commas all on it
Audemar shine like some Armor All don't it
Fresh out of fucks giving in to my opponent
Tell him you can keep your baby mama I don't want it
I'mma go motherfucker man, better watch what you say
I ain't taking shit from no motherfucker man
Fuck a piece I want the whole motherfucking thing
Can you hear me?
Go tell the promoter hundred racks for an appearance
Go play in another city rap before I'm here
You a fuck nigga
I know you ain't one of us, nigga
She sucking everybody dick and you all in the club with her
Like you all in love with her
Everybody know what's up with her
Ayy, run a hatchet like a flat pole
I've been getting it since Kermit the Frog was a tadpole
