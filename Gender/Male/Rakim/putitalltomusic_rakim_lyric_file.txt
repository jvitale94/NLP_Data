Put it all to musiiiiic!
Makes you feel exactly like... (uh!)
Put it all to musiiiiic!
Makes you feel exactly like... (sounds good, uh!)
Put it all to musiiiiic! (no matter what you doin'!)
Makes you feel exactly like... (uh!)
Put it all to musiiiiic! (ch'eah, you know what it is!)
Don't it drive you craaaazyyyyyy? (uh!)


I usually fall asleep on it and wake up to it (uh-huh!)
In the morning draw plans in the day up to it. (uh!)
And make it easy to cope - and say just do it (that's right!)
Like all I hear is C-Notes, it's cake up music!
Get your weight up! - Workout (uh!) and shape up to it (uh!)
It make me hype for ladies like to shake butt to it. (uh!)
We crank up music just to make us lose it. (ch'eah!)
{Don't it drive you craaaazyyyyyy?}
And nothing can match the brain rush you get,
And save plush you flip when playin' something to sick. (uh!)
You can bug to it or make love to it (uh-huuuh!)
Sometimes we break up to it (uh!) just to make up to it (uh!)
A safe drug! No-one knows what makes us use it (uh-uh, uh-uh!)
And make us love music though the hate run through it.
It's the soundtrack of life, (uh!) turn the bass up to it! (ch'eah!)
{Don't it drive you craaaazyyyyyy?}

Memories blend and vision to it. (uh-huh!)
It's like a throwback! (uh!) - You can go back, (uhh!) reminiscing to it!
You taking it out of your mind. - It's stuck in your mug;
You under an influence of an infinite buzz. (uh-huh!)
It's like a hippy from the sixties (uh!) when you mix it with drugs.
