I don't shoot to kill I play to win
Stay catchin' up with the cutthroats, and make sure
Throw em off the tugboats, no floats
The body sinks to the bottom 
Or left on the side of the road smell rotten 
The murder sprees, random killings 
Ghostface Killahs, back attack 
Villians hangin from the ceiling 
Godfather motives, gangster mentality 
Black superhero with the immortality, forever
I be cheaper than the blackness
Ill night vision, with the militant tactics 
Glide through the air like a swarm of bees 
Shake niggas off quick like a dog with fleas
Raw me, leave bodies slumped in the street
Revenge is the spice of life it's so sweet

Hey yo pipe bombs blowing the souls to Jesus
Don't need nothing but the puzzle glue for the pieces
Meat cleaver cut fingertips like rib tips
Home invasions, cars gonna flip the lucas lose, tear cement shoes
Toss in the ocean, pop em tell they brain ooze
I wont lose
Blood up on my apron
Hog tie em up while they try to escape and peep the visual
Tied em up individual took their clothes off season em like sausages  
Like a pit stop to eat em that's the remedy
Attack, kill, bite off their extremities 
Blood bath splash my name on the wall 
Pull a piece delivery 
Leave a tip in the store
With an arm, leg, head, 
I'm comin for you all

Uh, huh, it's the sure shot
Yo yeah, heart of a lion
King of the jungle 
I'm a humble killer bee, you as soft as a bumble
I don't crumble I strike back hard with a vengeance 
Attack through these killer words I spit in a sentence 
I'm a menace, the black card cape caped crusader
The face of a ghost I disappear in the vapors
You can murder my flesh and bone, soul's invisible 
Revenge my death, pay back's the main principle
Protect your neck when you move, I'll be lurking in the shadows
Starks negate it, I never lose a battle 
Pimp with a superhero logo on my chest
Big Gucci link, GFK on the crest 
Icy arm for the eagle with the 8 karat ruby eyes
Piss on your arm, while I'm stupid high 
All black down royalty purple on some ice chips
Two glock nines pointed at you in a hype flick

Yo yo 
Now I'm alone in the room, and I just stare at the wall
Revenge my death but I'm going through withdrawals 
My loss I missed him, the new power and wisdom 
Got me thinking I made a whole lot of bad decisions
Got locals still to deal with, should I kill her?
Throw her ass in the cage with a gorilla
Or let her live and treat her like scum of the earth
I got goons to feed and babies to birth
I'm the God now, plus I'm a super rich nigga
Do more help than harm, either way you figure
Should I protect and serve or 
Cock and end to destruction 
Let the enterprise take over the force of production 
Corruption, my mind space is unpredictable 
I'm bulletproof now, back from the dead I'm invincible
