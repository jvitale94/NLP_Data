


And they think they know you
Til one day they show you
So no matter what they say
I go hard
And they think it's over
But it's never over
Cuz soon as you think I'm down
I go hard


You done benched that bitch card
Been here before
But don't ever let them see you
On the ground
Dues what you gotta pay
And people see you gotta say
So don't ever let them see you
On the ground




Yeah, yo, aiyo, dangerous thoughts, mind of a militia
Bottles of the 150th, poured over twisters
Broken bones, The Pillage, Staten Island's the illest
The biggest land fillers, we creep like caterpillars
Love raising, dirty guns with a few bodies
Teach niggas how to walk again, from the fucking shotty
Sixth sense, six pack, six degrees of separation
My evil third eye blinks with no hesitation
Dust bags, spoonfuls, the sugar help the medi'
Go down smooth and steady, blowing the green deadly
Hang weed pops, isolator of hash bricks
Needle left stuck in his arm, died of a bad fix
We still rock, still dry drawers on the stove
Got bread from back in the day, it's growing some more
2Pac's back, my glock's fat
After the gun smoke, you screaming "Where my block at?"




I go hard like Listerine on bacteria
Hulk's so hard, he got the power to Avenge ya
I go hard, herbal tea, kidney cleanser
I go hard, L.A., Dwight Howard
Hoods pounding hard, too much smoke in the chimney
Fire plus iron evaporates the enemy
Jason Statham, Mechanic, all mechanically
Right about now, I can really use some Hennessey
I go hard like you never thought I could
One swing with the hammer, the nail's in the wood
My Iron Fist is so ridiculous
Forever continuous, venomous and dangerous
