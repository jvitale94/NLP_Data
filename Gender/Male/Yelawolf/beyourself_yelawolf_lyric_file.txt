You know, I don't give a fuck about how much money you got
Who you know, none of that
Be authentic, that's the type of people I want to kick it with

Motherfucker I'm, a catalyst of the baddest that you can find
Cowboy hat, see me crooked in the corner of the club when I'm sippin, my
Jack, beautiful woman on my side
Fact, you ain't gotta tell me, I know, I'm fucking getting it
Fake motherfuckers just talk, I'm fucking living it
Chevy in the parking lot
But I've had a few homes, I'm a have to Uber home, I'm a have to pull my phone out
Hippy I come, baby then I'm moving on, but I won't do it alone, uh
Take a walk with a wolf, girl
I can make a good girl a hood girl
We can get down and party, shaking the Chevy
But whatever happens in the truck, if you could, girl
Please just be yourself

Be somebody, make somebody say you're like no one else
Nobody wanna hang with somebody that is boring
I'd rather be by myself and drink on the Porch Swing
So hold your breath if you can't be yourself
Be somebody, make somebody say you're like no one else
Nobody wanna hang with somebody that is boring
I'd rather be by myself and drink on the Porch Swing
So hold your breath if you can't be yourself


I love it, I love it
I'm buzzing enough just to fucking (go nuts)
Fuck discussion, ain't discussing nothing, I'm just gon' (roll, up)
Show up, show out, big dog, watch how that money go (fold up)
Didn't know then, but we know now, them clowns we ain't never (told us)
So what? You know what?
That stuff there is what had made me (grow up)
Think I can't? Bitch, think we ain't, think what you think you (ho, slut)
Let that tongue besides both nuts
Then swallow this whole pole up
While me and Singer Wolf pour up
Show love
Be Yourself


Be somebody, make somebody say you're like no one else
Nobody wanna hang with somebody that is boring
I'd rather be by myself and drink on the Porch Swing
So hold your breath if you can't be yourself
Be somebody, make somebody say you're like no one else
Nobody wanna hang with somebody that is boring
I'd rather be by myself and drink on the Porch Swing
So hold your breath if you can't be yourself

Step up in this motherfucker with a black hoodie cause I might seem cool, yeah
Spillin' so much ink on the paper I could have filled up Drake's pool, yeah
They told me to get ready but I've been ready, fucking babies were back in school, yeah
An animal, Hannibal, cannibal couldn't manage to get a handle, I'm too sick
Butters off, leather seats creeping up an alley in the Caddi like "who's this"
Catfish, hold up
When you see me coming, homie, throw the deuces
Got a couple of killers in a camp, wanna dance motherfuckers is ruthless
Back in the, back of the Chevy holding something heavy, g-g-g-get it, let's go!

Be somebody, make somebody say you're like no one else
Nobody wanna hang with somebody that is boring
I'd rather be by myself and drink on the Porch Swing
So hold your breath if you can't be yourself
Be somebody, make somebody say you're like no one else
Nobody wanna hang with somebody that is boring
I'd rather be by myself and drink on the Porch Swing
So hold your breath if you can't be yourself
