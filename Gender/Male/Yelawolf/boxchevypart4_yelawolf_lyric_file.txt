


I just popped some pills,
And all I want to do is not to feel,
Like a fucking ball on a soccer field,
'Cause everybody seems so not for real.
While this moon is up,
I want to ride around with you in the trunk.
I hope you don't mind I assumed you was,
'Cause I went and got a room for us.
So let's drink some drinks,
Until we get so drunk we can't wait,
To pull each other's clothes off and get naked,
And make the motherfucking Chevy shake.


Now I'm feeling fine,
In my 1979,
Trunk full of knock and the cup with the lime,
And I think that it's about that time.
So give me a shot.
I'm a take it up to the mountain top,
Or we could make it bounce in the parking lot,
Straight up in the police parking spot, fuck the cops.
We can roll,
All over the city we can go,
Everywhere you want to creeping low,
Baby I just want to beat the show.
So fuck that boom,
'Cause I got the Chevy engine tuned,
And I'll keep it running just for you,
While we illegally screw.
