

Lately I've been afraid of myself
The closer that I get to rain
The more I feel at home, the further I'm away
And all that I feel is pain

Count me, count me, call my name
Don't leave me out in shame
Crimson tears falling and my shirt is blood-stained
And the devil's forever in my veins
And the devil's forever in my veins

The morning's a cross I bear when I wake
Am I asleep if I've broken my faith?
Down on my knees, can you hear me when I pray?
Or am I a little too late?

Count me, count me, call my name
Don't leave me out in shame
Crimson tears falling and my shirt is blood-stained
And the devil's forever in my veins
And the devil's forever in my veins

Count me, count me, call my name
Don't leave me out in shame
Crimson tears falling and my shirt is blood-stained
And the devil's forever in my veins
And the devil's forever in my veins
