

Yeah, land of the free, home of the hard, home of the tough, survivors


We some gun toting, church going, 18-wheel rolling
Bag slanging, flag waving, at the dinner table praying
Old school yard fighting, beer drinking, hell raising
Hard working, blue collar, earn it all due paying
Illegal weed smoking, dope cooking, dirt dealers
On the corner bible preachers
Hollywood dream seekers
Muddy water swimming in
Rockin Roll all the time
Straight from the assembly line
And that’s how it’s made!


That’s how it’s made in the U.S.A., the U.S.A.
A manufactured dream, a fraction of a thing
We got it made, in the U.S.A., the U.S.A.
Isn’t it great? How we got it made


We some 9 to 5 back breaking
Food Stamp line waiting
Convict time giving
Underage time taking
Neighborhood gang banging
Subway graffiti painting
Big cars, street stars
Young dirty money making
Old money home taking
Clothes in the yard throwing
Late on the rent paying
Foul mouth word saying
One-way street paving
Road to success, but you gotta do some concrete laying
That’s how it’s made!


That’s how it’s made in the U.S.A., the U.S.A.
A manufactured dream, a fraction of a thing
We got it made, in the U.S.A., the U.S.A.
Isn’t it great? How we got it made


She’s been eating lies we fed her
Shoulda been full but nothing’s helping
Knew she wanted something better
Still she took the second helping
Now she’s well known, broke and cold
Fendi jackets, full of holes
No one knows


Single mother child raising
From the stripper poll swinging
Daughter in the red light
Coals for the cold season
She don’t speak, no reason
Why? Cause no one will ever know
That’s what? That’s how it’s made!


That’s how it’s made, in the U.S.A. the U.S.A.
It’s every mother’s dream
To see her daughter on her knees
Well we got it made, in the U.S.A., the U.S.A.
Isn’t it great? How we got it made
That’s how it’s made in the U.S.A.
