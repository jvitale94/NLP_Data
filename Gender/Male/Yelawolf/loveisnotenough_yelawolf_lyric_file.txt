Took off, fucking with some college graduate
Punk ass, Abercrombie wearing motherfucker
Left me broken-hearted in the Chevy
It's all good though, know why?
I got me bitch

Both of us was in the same class
In '02 in Antioch Nash-Ville
And I wanted you so bad
That I forgot to mark my manners
Everybody wanted them panties
Every guy was hoping to land it
We would flirt around and touch hands
Until we fucked around and took zanex
And that's when you began to drive me bananas
I was in denial it's apparent
You began to lie to your parents
You should know that I can't live
Without you holding my name
Now my heart's in control of my brain
And I can't hold it in the lanes

Rollin down 20 man
With this jack in my cup
Feeling down on my luck
And I'm doing 120 man
Maybe I'm giving up
Baby I'm giving up
Baby what is happening?
Don't you believe in us?
Don't you believe in us?
She said I know you gave me everything
But love is not enough
Love is not enough
Love is not enough

Used to fuck so much we missed school
You was there when I needed you
I was there when you needed me
We were inseparable
And I was broke with no fucking food
You was tough enough to be cool
Skate holes under my shoes
Dope boys had me confused
I was in love with hip hop
You was in love with that too,
What made it come to a stop?
Had to have been the money issue
Bitch
And I really miss the rain
I gave you all of my soul
And I got left was a key chain

Rollin down 20 man
With this jack in my cup
Feeling down on my luck
And I'm doing 120 man
Maybe I'm giving up
Baby I'm giving up
Baby what is happening?
Don't you believe in us?
Don't you believe in us?
She said I know you gave me everything
But love is not enough
Love is not enough
Love is not enough

Who the fuck are you fucking now?
Bet he's always taking you out
College-educated and proud
Me, well I'm just a drop out
Can't really blame ya for bugging
Ain't I the dirt on your rug
And just a place to wipe your shoes
And give me all your thrown away loving
Back to my buzzing and drugging
Back to my gutter with nothing
Back to the all of a sudden cracks
In the covenant trust in me
You ain't gotta worry bout sharing this success with Wyane
Now it's just petty change
But I still feel the pain

Rollin down 20 man
With this jack in my cup
Feeling down on my luck
And I'm doing 120 man
Maybe I'm giving up
Baby I'm giving up
Baby what is happening?
Don't you believe in us?
Don't you believe in us?
She said I know you gave me everything
But love is not enough
Love is not enough
Love is not enough
