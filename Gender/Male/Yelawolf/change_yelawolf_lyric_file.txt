Had to walks hours before I found this new kind of road
Had to spend months inside a dark room with my candles blown
But I came out with a light that blind at then end though
Oh I mean a book, cause a book of Neanderthals
Could it be what it what they though it was, well it's kinda known
And it's kinda yes when they dress up my talents grow
This ain't a star but I got life like a planet though
I was just a bud and would knew that the plant would grow
Flowers and I got flower power like Abbey Road
I caught the sun shower drenched in a pot of gold
Bless you with this twinkling pile of smoke
The wind got in my sails in the creek, water no paddle boat
Nobody picking me off the ground when my saddle broke
It don't matter though, a horse is a horse
Plus I needed the workout, I'm kinda glad it broke
I'm ecstatic, better yet, I'm in that kinda mode
That classics are made from

I done felt myself change
(Where will you go now, what will it take)
I done felt myself change
(Is it true now, or just play)

Yeah that's me, with a fifth of that Jack D
Still ridin' dirty to 8-ball MJG
Still got the house in the little hood that raised me
Still know dope boys, I talk to em daily
Still got that red neck family who loves me
Still hop out of trucks in the heart of Dixie
Don't try to put me back, I'm apart of my history
Because I'm creative, smart and thrifty
Cause i take the shotgun, a PBR no sippin'
Jump in the Chevy through some Catfish Billy trippin'
Hop on the 808, when I'm pimpin' you know I'm pimpin'
Never gave a fuck about the lines I crossed when I'm playing chicken
Raised on the Bible Belt with the cross I was made a Christian
What's up world? I'm in Alabama chillin'
And I just stuck a shot for the ones who stop and they hit the ceiling
Drop the top on the 65 in Nash, I can still here em, they're saying

(Where will you go now, what will it take)
I done felt myself change
(Is it true now, or just play)
I done felt myself change
(Where will you go now, don't turn around)

Do not succumb to the masses ideas
Or the ridicule and the judgement
Of those who follow the ideas of the weak
Will perish and they did fall of enlightenment
Become the vision of the minds eye
And carry your flame to the fire
Do not wait for the fire to carry the flame to you
Build, work, build, work, build, work
Fall down, fail, learn, learn, earn, earn and conquer
Money is the tool for a creation of the creative space
Do not squander the value of a gift from a friend
Family, strangers, enemies, Atheists, partisans, peddlers, people
People in this ocean of hungry minds
Feed, do no starve
Start now, wake up now
A trillion more lives will live happy before one of those trillion care a lot about your happiness
Love yourself and hate only you
If you don't...
