Trunk Muzik
Burn One
Burn One


Straight from the back of the game I rock it
Yelawolf's got that crack boy
In the woods with the SK I'm cockin'
You don't wanna play with that toy
Droppin' this heat like an asteroid
Good in the south like pastor troy
Pull up aside of a 1977
Sittin' back and sipping my crown
And 7 pimping I'm about
And I'm about to get down
Look at me changing lanes
Twin pipes looking like dragon's breath
(Whoosh) Chevrolet's blowing flames
Yes I know it's strange
Hit you in the left eye
Pull the chains
Bitch you too heavy to carry
You don't wanna bury yourself
Underneath the 808 I'm Droppin
In your face like


To The DJ's
Out Cruisin'
I got that Trunk Muzik
Everybody hop in the Cadillac
And idle back on the throttle Chevrolets
With the bottom won't you roll the window down
If you cruising
I got that Trunk Muzik
Alabama's unanimous animal Yelawolf
On the 808 come and fade away ain't no other way to get down


Told you I was coming
Said I'd be here in 5
And even though I brought you glasses
You still can't believe your eyes
But if you don't believe it by now
FUCK it just lean to the side
Hold up wait a minute I don't really
Wanna leave without a single solitary
So when needed for I'll bring it to em
If your sailing catch my drift
Lead me to the door check my list
Meet me at the floor catch this fist
Or meet me at the store catch this lick
Build this house flip this brick
Real skateboarders feel this grip
Moving through the alley way
Look at the people tripping
Cause I'm only chopping like




I have to be the hardest I've got diamond nuts
I piss excellence Ricky bobby lines 'em up
Catfish billy half pints or more
Yelawolf country fries 'em up
Put 'em in a duffle bag then I roll up in a river then I hold up
Watch what the fuck you hold up
Dynamite sticks will blow up
Ghetto vision got this sold up
Roll up smoke up
Everybody wishing they chose us
But we don't give a fuck you know what
I know you didn't see me coming but I'm coming anyway
Bitch Yelawolf is styling on you
