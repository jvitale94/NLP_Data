Still sipping on Jack D to my neck and my head start feeling (HEAVY)
Doing 125 down I-29 really think i need to start slowing down
But I can't cause i gotta pretty blonde thing sitting to my right that's blowing me now

Awww naw do you come in two's please choose a couple of friends that could hoppy in the coupe
Now we going (STEADY) but I'm not looking for (LONGEVITY)
Pipes in the back, the lights of the night reflect sights trough the dash I'm nice to ride past


My rims are super clean, paint job that glitters and gleams,
and I wanna see the back of your jeans in the seats (MY BOX CHEVY)
This whip is built for Queens and you wanna be seen with the King,
well I wanna see the back of your jeans in seats (MY BOX CHEVY)
Tilted off Jim Bean, sitting off to the side I lean,

Fuck a limousine I'd rather ride caprices
My speakers vibrate the concrete beneath us
Riding 85 northbound shaking doors down
So I turn the speakers louder pissing off polices
Fuck 5-star chick, got a porn-star bitch riding shotgun with me getting so wet
Now she going down on me giving road head busting on her forehead,
then I take her back to the homestead PEACE
Back in the caprice took a sack of weed and crumpled it inside a Cognac blunt wrap
Then its time to jump back on the highway 85 slumping in the seat like I'm hunchback and
My Chevy look so dope oldskool vo's on it got it floating like a row boat,
gold flakes in the paint dripping on the road, driving slow like a show boat hoe
Don't act like you don't hear me coming I got the Willie Sherman and its coming out the clarions
12's in the trunk, flatscreen TVs in the headrest with "Something About Mary" on carry on
I be turning heads every time when you see in the Chevy man she car struck
and I'm far from hauled up so quit tripping like a bitch
get in the car slut you know you wanna ride.

In the the background with the six-pack and riding looking for the (LADIES)
Peanut butter seats have seat girl my peanut butter needs (JELLY) I'll chase you like (JELLY)
if you ain't afraid to get (MESSY)
If you know the game then I'll let you call the shots like a referee
Now I'm drinking deuce deuce sweet and slow
feeling like I'm Deuce Deuce Bigalow
played the the bitch like piccolo
go anywhere you wanna go pick a road
Interstate 59 20 75 285 85 southbound
twins pipes like POW POW, 100 spokes on the vo's like wow..wow...wow
