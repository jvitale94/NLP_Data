It ain’t about the money
I’ma blow it all
I made my own lane
Let’s roll! Let’s roll!
Yeah, I’m going off
Ain’t got a whole lot
But I’ma show it off
Better recognize game
Let’s roll! Let’s roll!


Yeah, now let me welcome you to my small town
Big trucks in the yard, big bucks on the wall
Country folks all around
How I was raised, 808 drums quake and they shake that Box ‘88
And the dope boys’ hotter than Hell’s gate, but I,
Still in the shade, with a fold out chair and a 30 pack on the back of that tailgate
A-L-A–B-A-M-A,
I’m off, I might pee in a lake
I might go to Talladega and see me a race
And bring me a case
Yeah, I’m bringing a case, I’m getting throwed off




And I’m all the way throwed off
Z-71 take the bow off
Dipped in mossy oak with a mullet Mohawk
With a bright orange hat and a bat underneath that Chevy seat
Yea buddy might go off, split you like a bowling ball
Spit to you in my overalls
Home of the Gummo
Gotta couple a' folks that'll do it to you for the hundo
And when them elephant feet rumble
That Dixie cups gonna fall out of the console
You don't wanna have a convo
And not understand that ‘Bama slanguage like
"Holler" and "ain’t it", but I come to paint
So you won’t get throwed off




I’m just a kid that rocks
I’m just a boy with a dream
That bet it all with the last bill that I had hid in my socks
Used to keep a 22 in a shoe box
Now I bang Beretta
She’s twenty-two but I keep her in a tube top
White trash and all
Take us all the way to the top and then laugh it off like
How the fuck did I get a catalog
With more hits than a fuckin’ jack hammer dog
Cause I planned it all
Crimson Tide standing tall
Shit, I’m another lit cannon ball
Fuck around and I’m goin’ off and I’m getting throwed off
