And so Drama beats.


Hold up
Damn rich, peanut butter guts in a Lamborghini, whoa
You must have white bread, let's make a sandwich
Now, I ain't never seen money like you got
Nobody got that kind of money in the Boondocks
So if you take me up show me the Balcony looking over
The Hollywood valley I'll make your balloon pop
Pop stars like you, you need a dude like me
To appreciate your wealth
I know you got an elevator in your house
But with me you appreciate the steps
Act like you don't wanna see how much of this Jack Daniels you can handle
You wanna drink and get cut like Rambo?
And let me drive your Daddy's Lambo


Take me up to Beverly Hills to your Daddy's mansion
Let me see Hollywood for real
Lights, camera, action
I've seen you partying with Kim, entertainment channel
One thing I gotta know
Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo?
Lambo-o-oh
Your Daddy's Lambo?
Lambo-o-oh
Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo?
Lambo-o-oh
Your Daddy's Lambo?
Lambo-o-oh
Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo?


You're young and reckless, nice little diamond necklace
Got a pint sized vodka drink and your pretty in pink
Wanna go get breakfast
Though you ain't never been to waffle house
Always hanging in guys and dolls
If you came to the shop, I'd put you in a Chevrolet and we slide to the mall
Yeah I came to the club in a pair of Famous jeans and DTA hoody
But I'm walkin' through the party with rogue status looking for Beverly Hills goody's
Yelawolf and I'm an Alabama boy
Got more bounce than a salamander boy
Need a rich girl like I need a headache
But I'll take it if I can drive your Daddy's toy


Take me up to Beverly Hills to your Daddy's mansion
Let me see Hollywood for real
Lights, camera, action
I've seen you partying with Kim, entertainment channel
One thing I gotta know
Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo?
Lambo-o-oh
Your Daddy's Lambo?
Lambo-o-oh
Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo?
Lambo-o-oh
Your Daddy's Lambo?
Lambo-o-oh
Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo?


What you got in that tote bag
That one of a kind Prada
That beautiful behind inspires me
Makes one of my rhymes harder
Your daddy made a fine daughter
Make me wanna turn this wine from water
Keep the party going in and keep an 808 bumping cause Drama made a beat that'll climb the chart
Money, money, money, money, money
Ain't it funny what a hunny and a Lamborghini will do
Some will run into a hundred dollar bill
And drill a dick on any Tom and Harry with them 24 inch shoes
But come and explore this dude
Analyze my swing
It's slick Rick E. Bobby baby
Gotta let me drive that thing, come on


Take me up to Beverly Hills to your Daddy's mansion
Let me see Hollywood for real
Lights, camera, action
I've seen you partying with Kim, entertainment channel
One thing I gotta know
Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo?
Lambo-o-oh
Your Daddy's Lambo?
Lambo-o-oh
Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo?
Lambo-o-oh
Your Daddy's Lambo?
Lambo-o-oh
Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo?


Just whip it around you know
Up the hills
I ain't gonna wreck it, I promise
Sit yo drunk ass back
Drama Beats, Yelawolf, ghettovision
What up Rob Dyrdek
Fantasy Factory Bitch
Holler at chyea
