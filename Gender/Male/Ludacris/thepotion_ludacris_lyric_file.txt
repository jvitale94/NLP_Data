But can't trace that Matta fact erase that cause I'm this late track get you face slapped and I'm
Straight so don't taste that try something different and shit I'm listening and shit speaking about

To me now but it ain't like me people swear they sike me just cause he's light-skinned with braids in
His hair don't mean that nigga look like me trick get you mind right living in a limelight so

Jump down turn around
Pick a bale of cotton
Jump down turn around
Pick a bale of hay
Oh Lordy pick a bale of cotton
Oh Lordy Pick a bale of hay


Still working like a slave
Learning tricks in the trade in the ghetto state of mind till I'm rich and I'm paid picking records
Like cotton in the thick of the day
Till I'm spoiled and I'm rotten and they send us away life no different that ozar minimum wage
Mo money but still locked in a similar cage either losers of tomorrow or we winners today, Now just that and theres
Really nothing missing to say but
