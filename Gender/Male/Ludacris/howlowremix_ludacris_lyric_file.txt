Ha ha!
I'm in the zone right now baby
LUDA! Listen...


Ludacris got a remix, finna go low, hold up, let me get my camera
I wanna see Arizona, Indiana, Minnesota, and the women in Louisiana
D.C., VA, Motor City to the Lou', what it do? Finna blow like Waco
Chi-town goin way low, both Cakalakas, Alabama to the M-I-Yayo
New York, California, Philly and they really put it on me when I'm down in Texas
Album numero siete, get ready for the "Battle of the Sexes"
I'm restless, tryna tell 'em that I'm hotter than the burn in the 3rd de-GREE, GREE
then I try to tell 'em ain't nobody in the world as hot as ME! ME!
If you really goin low, you gotta go -- HARD!
Go lower than the grades on yo' report -- CARD!
GAWD! Ludacris, I'm the best that ever did it, did it
and when it comes to the money I'm like, "Don't stop - {GET IT, GET IT}"
WHOOO!!


HOW - LOW - CAN YOU GO? HOW - LOW, CAN YOU GO?
HOW - LOW - CAN YOU GO? HOW - LOW, CAN YOU GO?
HOW - LOW - CAN YOU GO? HOW - LOW, CAN YOU GO?
HOW - LOW - CAN YOU GO? HOW - LOW, CAN YOU GO?

 
I can go looooooow, lower than you know
Go looooooow, l-l-l-lower than you know
Go looooooow, l-l-l-lower than you know
Go looooooow, l-l-l-lower than you know


See me in The A, I drop it down low
I back this thing up and make, mo' money more
I hear you up in my ear like, "Go shawty go!"
Naw, I ain't a stripper but I do it like a pro
You said this girl cain't make it bounce like this
Well, shawty I'm da shit! (yep!) Shawty, I'm da shit!
Lady in the street - you, know the rest
Put yo' money on the flo' {HOW - LOW - CAN YOU GO?}
See I got you watchin, everytime I drop it
Everytime I rock it's, "WOOMP! - There she go"
Like you wanna marry me, like you wanna take me home
I'ma put it on ya shawty, WOOMP! - Here I go 




I can go looooooow (Go low), lower than you know
Go looooooow (Go looow), l-l-l-lower than you know
Go looooooow (Go loow), l-l-l-lower than you know
Go looooooow (Go looow), l-l-l-lower than you know
