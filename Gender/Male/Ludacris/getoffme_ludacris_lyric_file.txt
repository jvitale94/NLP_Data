Get off me, but I'm on you all day
Get off me, I don't think you wanna play


 You wanna rush me, you can't touch me, trust me
cause you weigh too dusty, and rusty, and musty
 You betta shop that make you pop up from lock up
but you tell your folks to hold you're jack up to back up (to back up)
 I'm ready, so sit down or go ta' your room
 It ain't nothinnnnn
 A a watch out watch out, boom
Call me the hit man, 'cuz I make you wanna call time-out
Then I make your mom cry-out, when I take your whole spine out
then watch me take ya, and fake ya, and shake ya, and break ya
and see you on hoooome to your maker
 You should give up now for talkin shit like that
But then you nothing, you garbage you betta' watch ya' back



 (OK, OK now)
 I'm in that 2000 excursion
 Ridin on 22's, I hear da boom
 But booms just get more crunk
 It's the DSGB forever
 Ridin on pump
 I stunk, or did I say stunk, I meant stank (UN huh)
I think I'll take it please, or in another coffee break
you aint, but you can pretend to be homey
 I'm stiff arming these busters just as soon they get on me
