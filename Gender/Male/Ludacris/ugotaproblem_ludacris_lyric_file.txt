College Park waterboy, spit in the c-cooler

Women indeed, keep ya eyes closed
Keep yo' eyes closed, 'bow blows, come on out dem clothes hos
Low pros, low bows, watch out for the po-po
And I chose, to be dat numba one contender
Southern offender, fuckin up ya whole agenda
When I walk you try to run, when I run you try to hide
You skate at the snap of my fingers call me +Golden Glide+
Its you and I, Do or Die, who am I?
I got a pocket full of +Family Stone+, cats think I'm +Sly+
Ohh why try?  You one of dem niggaz that like to cheat death
And I'm one of dem niggaz

You shit out wheat chex, and fart out deep breaths
While we toss darts at the bottom of y'all v-necks

And y'all don't want no scrubs til y'all pull out y'all extensions
Y'all in school detention that'll neva come out
Man I'll cut yo achilles tendon and put a sock in yo' mouth
Cause we da shit in the South, they know what I'm talkin bout
You see we Jack and we Daniels, y'all Earl and Ralph

No glove, no love, betta tell yo' dick to run for cover
So when lightnin strikes, you can be safe on a few rubbers

Self-explanitorium, ass-valedictorian
I bring 'em "Back to the Future" like a '85 Delorean
The Luda drug emporium, ON the counter prescriptions
You like my diction and my doctor/nurse convention
I place the stethoscope quite close to yo tittie
and have yo butt checks Red-man like Uncle Quilly
