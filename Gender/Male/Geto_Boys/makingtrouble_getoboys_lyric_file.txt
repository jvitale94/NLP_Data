There's so much trouble in our life, we got a story to tell
Just like time, we did the crime, and had the cops so sick
They tried to catch us, nothin happened, cause we're much too slick
I'm Juke Box, the back-breaker, pose a threat on your life
I slice you up, like Freddy Krueger, lyrics sharp like a knife
And I'm Johnny C the Prince of rhymin, imitators die
You know why? Boy, it's the vengeance of my rappin ally
He's Ready Red, the top contender, other boys who oppose
So catch the square, and he'll be there, and he'll break your nose
We're makin trouble

That's right, we're makin trouble

I've got an Uzi in my hand and I'm in command
I run the nation, say what, Take out the Ku-Klux Klan
I got 'em scared to walk the street after it gets dark
And play con on your sister at Tuffy Park
We're makin trouble

That's right, we're makin trouble

Boy, I saw your Filas, say what, And I was on cloud nine
I said Box, busted out, I got to make those mine
I jacked you up off your feet, I snatched out your strings
Size 10, and just right for me to do my thing
We're makin trouble

That's right, we're makin trouble

I, what, broke out the store window, with a crime on his mind
With no thoughts or assumption, word, of doin the time
The cop screamed, boy freeze! .45 in his hand
I dropped the VCR, broke out and ran
I stole the jams off your car, and now it's up on blocks
I snatched the emblem off your Caddy, boy, and you're red hot
We're makin trouble

That's right, we're makin trouble

Now for all you small timers, we got to make you slob
Cause we don't only steal cars, homeboy, we also rob
I robbed a store to get a dollar, I snatched a purse, the lady hollered
Then the cops come to my door, and snatch me up right by the collar
And now they're takin me to jail, yo-yo, a man-made hell
But from behind the steel bars, we could never prevail
The Ghetto Boys are trouble makers, cold common thugs
Tearin down the neighborhood, but we don't do drugs
We're makin trouble

That's right, we're makin trouble
