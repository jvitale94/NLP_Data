


I sit alone in my four-cornered room staring at candles
"Cool out man, we in the Radio dukes"
We're in the Radio dukes
"yeah"
Ooh, alright, check this here


At night I can't sleep, I toss and turn
Candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies bein' burned
Four walls closin' in gettin' bigger
I'm paranoid, sleepin' with my finger on the trigger
My mother's always stressin' I ain't livin' right
But I ain't going out without a fight
See, everytime my eyes close
I start sweatin' and blood starts comin' out my nose
There's somebody watchin' the Ack'
But I don't know who it is, so I'm watchin' my back
I can see him when I'm deep in the covers
When I awake I hear a call burnin' rubber
He owns a black hat like I own
A black suit and a cane like my own
Some might say, "Take a chill, B"
But I can't G, cause there's somebody trying to kill me
I'm poppin' in the clip when the wind blows
Every twenty seconds got me peepin' out my window
Investigatin' the joint for traps
Checkin' my telephone for taps
I'm starin' at the woman on the corner
It's messed up, when your mind is playin' tricks on you


I make big money, I drive big cars
Everybody know me, it's like I'm a movie star
But late at night, somethin' ain't right
I feel I'm being tailed by the same sucker's head lights
Is it that fool that I ran off the block?
Or is it that clown last week that I shot?
Or is it the one I beat for five thousand dollars
Thought he had caine but it was Gold Medal Flour
Reach under my seat, grabbed my popper for the suckers
Ain't no use to me lyin, I was scareder than a mother*****
Hooked a left into Pop eye's and bailed out quick
If it's goin' down, let's get this shit over with
Here they come, just like I figured
I got my hand on the chrome play the trigger
What I saw'll make your ass start gigglin'
Three black crippled and crazy senior citizens
I live by the sword
I take my boys everywhere I go, because I'm paranoid
I keep lookin' over my shoulder and peepin' around corners
My mind is playin' tricks on me


Day by day it's more impossible to cope
I feel like I'm the one that's doing dope
Can't keep a steady hand because I'm nervous
Every Sunday mornin' I'm in service
Prayin' for forgiveness
And tryin' to find an exit out the business
I know the Lord is lookin' at me
But yet and still it's hard for me to feel happy
I often drift while I drive
Havin' fatal thoughts of suicide
BANG and get it over with
And then I'm worry-free, but that's nonsense
I got a little boy to look after
And if I died then my child would be a bastard
I had a woman down with me
But to me it seems like she was down to get me
She helped me out in this
But to me she was just another chick
Now she's back with her mother
Now I'm realizing that I love her
Now I'm feelin' lonely
My mind is playin' tricks on me


This year Halloween fell on a weekend
Me and Geto Boys are trick-or-treatin'
Robbin' little kids for bags
Till an old man got behind our rags
So we speeded up the pace
Took a look back, and he was right before our face
He'd be in for a squabble no doubt
So I swung and and tried to take him out
He was goin' down, we planned
But this wasn't no ordinary man
He stood about six or seven feet
Now, that's the creep I'd be seein' in my sleep
So we triple-teamed on him
Droppin' them 5th ward B's on him
The more I swung the more blood flew
Then he disappeared and my boys disappeared too
Then I felt just like a fiend
It wasn't even close to Halloween
It was dark as death on the streets
My hands were all bloody from punchings on the concrete
God damn, homie
My mind is playin' tricks on me
