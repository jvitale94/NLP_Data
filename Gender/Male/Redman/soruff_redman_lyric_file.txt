Do you feel that the blacks in your community
are still mad at the racial situation?

 Yeah they still mad
And if you don't take that funny smirk off your face
I'ma kick your...

Over three hundred ghetto-related crimes happened
in Newark, New Jersey alone - still the saga continues


Stick em up, STICK EM UP!  I got the jammie to your vest punk
Don't make a move!  Before I choose to make your guts run
all over the block, cause my stomach's in a knot
and it growls twenty-four hours a day around the tick-tock
I got roaches and vats of the rats carryin bats and gats
so I  'fore I snack Jack
Because I'm not down with water from the hydrant
My moms takin a bath and my brother's next arrivin
I gotta think of a plan so I can eat
I haven't had a cracker for weeks so my mouth leaks
I squat up, cause I'ma set up this kid, carryin loot out
from Burger King and what I'ma do is..
run up on him, SNATCH the bag of money, then bust the dummy!
Cause my man when I think of a plan there's no shorts take
Cause I pack jammies inside of my Nordface, coat
Had the black brother on scope
No joke's what I am cause the man's a pure pro
(Yo my man you got a light?
 Yeah give me the effin money too G!)  Yo STOP STOP STOP!
Took the money then I dipped with the quickness
The plan went well so I got down to the business
Opened up the bag it was filled with paper
I thought I freaked the funk but now starts the caper
Cause I was set up, now I have to go head up with the cops
What they carryin?  Black glocks (shit's thick!)
What's the next move?  My life's on the line
Bullets in their clips and none in mine
Sirens on, once again it's on
I fell (OW!) and then the black glocks went POW!
I got snuffed and I got bust
Now the only thing I'm sniffin is dust, cause it's

("It's so rough!") 

Me and Erick Sermon takin a trip Uptown
In the ? run a blast and my tape pumpin ganja
Since Erick got props
I step to this hottie with more damn body than a chop shop
Flexed the jewels then she chose to talk to me
It was no doubt that baby cakes was hawkin me
So I kicked it, upped the digits, terrific
Not knowin she was scopin me cause I was MAD splifted
Later on that week honeydip freaked the funk
Playin Redman and Erick out like two chumps
Callin him weekdays, callin me weeknights
(Who had her weekends?)  Whichever man would freak right
Things got cozy one night like dynamite
We stripped to bare backs and took care of the bare facts
No hats?  Went Funkadelic
Took a splash, you know how that go fellas
Two months later (see you later alligator)
She was pissed and, I ended up seein my position
She took a blood test, she took a head check
Looked at me thinkin, "Why the hell he isn't dead yet?"
Then I asked her, "Why you lookin at me?!"
She said, "Redman because you have the HIV"
Called Erick and his set, that girl, don't mess around!
Too late, cause Erick already had his drawers down
Cause it's

("It's so rough!") 
 Cause it's so rough!

To all my brothers wear your hats wear your hats
You can either get with this or you can either catch the claps
And to my sisters, make em wear they prophyl-lastic
Cause it's drastic, havin another ghetto bastard
Think I'm vyin for a piece of butt?  Honey you must be nuts
You better settle for a wet kiss so pucker up
Cause you end up messin around catchin the heebie jeebies
Lookin like WHODUNNIT?  Witcha face up on the TV
So next time you want sex, get wreck, but protect
cause you could be like sexin to your last death
And if you still don't know the time, press rewind
cause the next thing you might hear is a flatline
