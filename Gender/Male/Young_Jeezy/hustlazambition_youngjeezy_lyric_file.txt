just as soon as I feel the drought I'm whippen up every block
I'm a good god fearin man with a criminal mind state
ain't nobody gave a shit and that's why we grind weight
my grandma off in the church while I'm in the frigerater 
in search of the baking soda right next to the mashed potatoes 
she prayin for better days 
I'm prayin to take this water realest in stunna-ship 
put that day on my mothers daughter...


My ambitions as a hustla (I won't deny it I'm a straight hustla. I won't deny it) 


It's Mr.Trap or die yeah you'll remember me first album was a classic 
them critics werent feelin me 
now as far as award shows we all know how that goes 
so what's all the doubt about because he ain't sellin out 
because he ain't givin up because he don't give a fuck 
because he ain't changin up I guess he ain't lean enough 
hey just know I'm savin up let you play with my sanity gives a fuck 
what you think of me unless you feedin my family 
mother fuck all my enemies one time for my mini me's 
listen to these niggas I bet you hear plenty me 
I'm who they pretend to be the one they pretend to do 
see me I'm a hustla I do what my hustlaz do...


My ambitions as a hustla (I won't deny it I'm a straight hustla. I won't deny it) 


Might not just be the best just know I plan to be 
I refuse to let suckers win but that's just the man in me 
look it could be the G in me these niggas ain't seein me 
unless they see me in traffic in somethin topless and drastics
I say I grind like there's 10 of me 
I swear to god there's just one of me look I know I ain't there yet 
just know that I'm gonna be I could'nt wait to see 
the day I could change where my momma stay... 
I put the B.S. BEHIND ME... 
THERES TOO MUCH MONEY IN FRONT OF ME...
