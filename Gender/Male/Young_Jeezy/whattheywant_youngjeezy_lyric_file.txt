Talkin' reckless on my line, now that's a technical foul

Catch me in the out field, that's a whole lotta of grass
Tryna buy the franchise, that's a whole lotta cash
Damn right I'm savin' up, think I might buy the team
Once I get my bounty up, tryna get my money clean
Focus quick watch the pitch can't afford another strike 
If I can make it through this, shit then I can play another night
Money right, money right, I gotta get my money right
First I gotta get these O's so make sure you wrap 'em tight
