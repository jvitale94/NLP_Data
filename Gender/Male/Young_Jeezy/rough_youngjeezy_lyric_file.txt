You know pyrex pots, you know they came with a top
And I just left the lot in a brand new drop
And I ain't pay for the roof cause me no likey the top
I make it rough on you niggas, I make it rough on you hoes
Quarter brick in my pocket, I spent that shit on my clothes
You know it costs a few hundred, yeah you should see what I drove
Clip hold half a hundred, I bought that shit for my pros

I make it rough on you niggas, I make it rough on you hoes
And it hold half a hundred, I bought that shit for my pros

Malibu and Ciroc, I think I just lost my top


I make it rough on these niggas
Man I make it rough on these hoes
Shot that lou kang to coopers?
Still got that cutlass on 4s
And I put the bounce with the bunnies
Cause they like the dust up they nose
Man I straight Lewinsky these bitches
Get brain and bust on they clothes
Might be my last night
Got gas and shit for the glass pipe
Hop out, hit a nigga with the act right
Niggas rap but they ain't about that life, is that right
You heard about them Gary niggas
That murder cap straight burry nigga
Gotta choppa thang you betta carry witchya
Dont come flexin my area nigga
My boost phone twerk
Hit a lick nigga who got work
Better go get Duct Tape
The nigga pump faked, his whole crew got burnt
And I crush his feelings
Copped that southern Cali condo when I killed him
Tried to get my nigga 
Young to move out 
West and cop the buildin
