Bad bitches everywhere, Barry White
Hit the things, I could bury white
Countin’ up a million dollars every night
Hit the mall blow up
Kinda hard when you’re sleeping on Dolce
Wake up drinkin Rose
Killin’ that white bitch, OJ


Smokin that exotic, riding that foreign
million dollar round trip, I ain't talkin bout touring
Yeah, countin’ money til ya boring
Man fuck that shit (jizzle where you goin?)
Flat screens on the walls, nigga iMacs
Michael Turners on decks, nigga half backs
Dirty white bitch, yeah that kat stacks
We don’t sleep round here, we take cat naps
Wesley Snipes, mothafucka its the money train
Swear the work came faster than the money came
Sometimes the money be faster than the cars is
Feds ain't watching and then them broads is
Could end anyday and you know better
Now you watch the frito lay, yeah you know cheddar
Double bags at the spot, luggage in the place
Louie V on deck, luggage on my waist




I woke up sayin’ I ain't drinking no more
Same night in the spot drinkin’ Coco
Loso, bad bitch think she know so
Got a man cuffin’, nigga think he popo
She tryna go below the belt, thinkin’ low blow
I’m thinking oh yeah, he thinkin’ oh no
I’m on my high horse, thinking Polo
Got the 9 on me so I think I’m Romo
Uh, I’m about that life
Bring you in the game, let you meet my wife
Married to the, asking am I gettin cheddar now
They say I do, like a wedding vow
That AirTran we flying for cheap
And you niggas sleepin’ on me, hope you die in your sleep
OJ, yeah probably don’t get it
I’m the best that ever did it and got away with it




Italian money and everything with ‘em
Gloves don’t fit ‘em so they gotta acquit him
Ain't nobody seen it, but everybody heard it
The whole town hatin’, they waitin’ on a verdict
Tell ‘em niggas pop off, I’m waitin on a drop off
I ain't leaving the block til I knock the box off
Yeah taking care of the whole fam
Bought the Porsche gave the M to my old man
More money more problems
More grams, more real estate, more land
At fight night I be ringside
I let them things fly, just put 1.5 under my kingsize
I look at the world through a kings eyes
I was born to spit bars and sling pies
I ain't wealthy yet but I’m quite rich
I just gotta keep killin’ that white bitch
