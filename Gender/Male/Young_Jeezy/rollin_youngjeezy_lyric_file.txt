Wake em down, I be in town Monday
It's for my niggas on the freeway
Riding dirty, let me take it easy
Everytime you see me on that 9-5 (rollin!)
22's sitting on them shit's boy!
Bad bitch on a steering wheel
A nigga just (rollin!)

Everytime you see me on the 7-5
We got them choppers in this bich, boy!
26's and we sitting on high
A nigga just (rollin!)


It's on y'all, I'm on y'all
That check come, we gon' ball
Like wins work, like John Wall
You hate that shit, don't y'all?
Real niggas, no cornballs
Pussy just a phone call
You stand this summer you gonna fall
I make it happen, I don't stall
Bullshit: don't try that
That full clip in my strap
That logo on my cap say "NY"
That's my trap. Shout out to my hood
Too real to fake that. A BK nigga, I was
Brought up on "take that
Then flip that, then take that"
You got ass, then shake that
Them ones drop like Lees ho
Tell somebody rape that
Riding down that 95 on my way to 85
I'm rolling while my lady drives
An all-black Mercedes ride



(Rollin!) Everytime you see me on that 95
22's sitting on them shit's boy!
Bad bitch on a steering wheel just
A nigga just (rollin!)


I'm riding, I'm rolling, I'm holding
Stop hoping my cell phone
Stop smoking. Beep beep! Phone call
Nigga you joking
M.I., NY, A-Town, he's Oakland
Just 
No words like Too Short
Vanilla cig Dutch Masters
I smoke them like Newports
Hood nigga in that Turbo
Naw we don't do sports
