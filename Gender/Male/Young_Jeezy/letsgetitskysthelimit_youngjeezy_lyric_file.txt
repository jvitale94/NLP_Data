

Trying to get Boston George and Diego money
And stack it all up like Lego money
Played with them blocks call it Tetris
Real talk a hundred carats in my necklace
Look up in the sky and tell me what you see
The clouds naw nigga not me
I see opportunity i'm a opportunist
Nigga you heard what I said i'm a opportunist
Soft to hard white to green
All these free agents you better build your team
I commentate the game like John Madden
Cause I played in the game like John Madden


The world is yours and everything in it
it's out there get on your grind and get it "ay"
Hands in the air, "sky's the limit nigga" hands in the air "yeah"
The world is yours and every bitch in it
It's out there get on your grind and get it "ay"
Hands in the air, "sky's the limit nigga" hands in the air "jeah"

You can do anything you put your mind to, put your grind to
Forgetful ass nigga must I remind you
Men do what the want boys do what they can
And it ain't no secret i'm a grown ass man
With my hands on the Bible and I solemnly swear
Leave the mall with more shoes than I can possibly wear
Niggas still hating but they can kiss my ass
Still get a hard on when I count that cash
I give em the squares he give me the bag
I give em the squares he give me the cash
And that's what the fuck a call an even exchange
And if there's anything extra you can keep the change


The world is yours and everything in it
it's out there get on your grind and get it "ay"
Hands in the air, "sky's the limit nigga" hands in the air "yeah"
The world is yours and every bitch in it
It's out there get on your grind and get it "ay"
Hands in the air, "sky's the limit nigga" hands in the air "jeah"

Grind sundown till it comes up again
Stay down till we come up again
It's all in the game the ups the downs
It's all in the game the O's the pounds
The shit was all good just a week ago
Whole click was eating good just a week ago
It's all good nigga give us a month
Thinking of a master plan while I smoke this blunt
Went to Houston and back now everybody got coupes
Put the word in the street that supply the troops
I just call 'em how I see em,
serve these niggas  third person dog I ain't trying to see 'em


The world is yours and everything in it
it's out there get on your grind and get it "ay"
Hands in the air, "sky's the limit nigga" hands in the air "yeah"
The world is yours and every bitch in it
It's out there get on your grind and get it "ay"
Hands in the air, "sky's the limit nigga" hands in the air "jeah"
The world is yours and everything in it
it's out there get on your grind and get it "ay"
Hands in the air, "sky's the limit nigga" hands in the air "yeah"
The world is yours and every bitch in it
It's out there get on your grind and get it "ay"
Hands in the air, "sky's the limit nigga" hands in the air "jeah"
