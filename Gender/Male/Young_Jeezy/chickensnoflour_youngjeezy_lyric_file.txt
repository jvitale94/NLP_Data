Took my j's off and they was in my socks
Stones that big I put them in my watch
Got something for you haters and it's in that glock
(We cooking chickens no flour, we count the money weigh the powder) 

I got my mind made I wanna be a millionaire
I got my mind made I take them bitches anywhere
I got pocket full of stones like I'm bun b
I got a pocket full of phones like I'm pimp c
What ya know snow or ghetto more like willie d
I park that lamb in that ghetto well that's silly of me (haha)
I got my backs packed yeah I'm thinking road trip
That mr. ice cream, rocky road trip
I'm about that getting green yeah I'm bumpin project back
I make it back with these blocks I bring the projects back
So I can cop that black benz for them chicken heads
I'm in the club spendin' ends yeah that chicken bread

This remind me of the time I thought lost my rocks
Took my j's off and they was in my socks
Stones that big I put them in my watch
Got something for you haters and it's in that glock
(We cooking chickens no flour, we count the money weigh the powder)

I'm in my 87' swiss that's my stove swag
I whip it till it's upset I make the stove mad
There's so much smoke up in this bitch man I can't see
And from a distance it look like I'm makin' iced tea (man you say ice t)
Everybody looks cocoa, when my dog was on I got them for the low low
I'm in that black on black lamb I call it country black
I threw them 30's on them lade now that's my country lac
Now what ya license plate say? I'm standin' to tall, now what that.40 cal say?
Bitch I will do ya'll, is it true you be rollin' with them chopper toys?
And everytime you in the club you with them chopper boys?

This remind me of the time I thought lost my rocks
Took my j's off and they was in my socks
Stones that big I put them in my watch
Got something for you haters and it's in that glock
(We cooking chickens no flour, we count the money weigh the powder)
