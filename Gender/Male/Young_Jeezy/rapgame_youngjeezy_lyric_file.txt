Till I came back in that black on black phantom ghost
Looking better the picasso ya'll should frame me
Killing niggaz kunta kinte ya'll should hang me


Rap game fucked up but u can't blame me
Seen em come seen em go U kno how the game be
Snowman's back young u to wild
Had to switch it up man niggaz tryna stiil the style


Anyway any how the stering wheel black and mild
Make the broad back that ass up think I'm juvenile
My leather to soft just like wayne and baby nem
Teacher ask me what I wanna be told dat bitch a atm
Dream was to turn my whole block into a cvs
Can't trust then broads around the way them bitches devious
Drop it in watch it make it circle like a dvd
62 and 1 25 half a quarter key


Rap game fucked up but u can't blame me
Seen em come seen em go U kno how the game be
Snowman's back young u to wild
Had to switch it up man niggaz tryna stiil the style


Anyhow anyway it's snitches born everyday
Best thing to do is get yo money and stay out the way
Hustla of the year damn right let's be very clear
If u sell them brick to rocks to stone then it's belvedere
Posted on the block with the choppas guess it's voka now
Hard slowed up niggaz switched playing socca now
Do it for the killa and the dealers kno u heard of me
Young came back to save the day see the argency


Rap game fucked up but u can't blame me
Seen em come seen em go U kno how the game be
Snowman's back young u to wild
Had to switch it up man niggaz tryna stiil the style
