I ain't bullshitting at all, need a tylenol
So I can lay it down and go to sleep till its time to ball
I can do this shit I'm my sleep I ain't trying at all
Bitch you know I been here before I ain't lying at all
Had to get back up on my feet, had to grind it up
Took them plastic bags out that box, I was tying em up
When I get that iced out watch, they'll be dying to fuck
Bitch I'm talking so many coupes, ill be dying to truck
So many colors on the chevy its candyland
Everytime I ride through the hood there go candyman
Three point fives and them sevens I'm hand to hand
Bitch I hit that brick with the hammer that handyman

Somebody roll another blunt I ain't ready to go
Bitch I'm just chillin doing me so just let me snow
Got that glock 9 and its ready to go
Hustler got no time for a cut I'm just lettin it grow
And I dont know where its coming from I'm just lettin it flow
Damn right this is what I duz I'm just lettin ya know
(say empty pockets just to get) I got bills to pay
So I had to add traffickin to my resume
Yea I rolled straight passed the task with a half today
Then I took some time countin cash that I had today
Thats why I had the rari for the deal just ask jazzy phae
Cuz I beat that bitch with that (fourth) just like (Annie May)
