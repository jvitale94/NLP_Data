The voice in my head say fuck all these niggaz
Then I start thinkin', I should rob all these niggaz
Man my homies then wan' do whatever I wan' do

Lets ride around find a nigga stuntin' on front street
With the shine's on niggaz be lookin' like lunch meat

I'm up early in the mornin', tryna make a move
Come in here with me shorty take your lil' on the school
Even though she cause the drama, you love your baby momma
I hit her with the llama to get this cake
Give us the coke, the cash, the combo to the safe
But she don't know it, damn, OK we'll wait
I play with your kid on the couch, while your bitch on the phone
Put a gun to her head sayin' daddy come home
You was rollin' poppin' bubbly, didn't think it get ugly
In the hood shit is lovely until it go bad
Now you can pray for a miracle and God might be hearin' you
That the nine will jam right in my hand

Niggaz be gettin' killed everytime you come around
We ran up in his crib made his momma kiss the ground
She askin' God, what my baby dunn did now?
I'm takin' everything, jewellery I want it all
Duck tape him up, rip the phone cords out the wall
Fuck waitin' we can startin' waitin' on tomorrow
So ask Satan if he got a car that I can borrow
I'm impatient like a money hungry rap star
I jack him for his chain and I can get a new Jaguar
The mack I have his brains all over the fuckin' sidewalk
And I'ma be on CNN again it ain't my fault
March nigga step, right nigga left
G-Unit soldier I'm thuggin' till my death
