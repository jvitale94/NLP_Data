This time it's gon take a whole SWAT team to bring me in
I'm back on this shit again
I'm back on this shit again


I had the same vision cat had in '89
So all the work in Southside gon be mine
I got project protection, that's 10 grand a building
Some niggas say that's there spot we gon kill 'em
It's all simple math, now add it to automatic
It's filled to the tip of the clip I let it rip
Now run, cover your mother it's on cocksucker
Fuck around, have a peice of your brain blown
Hop up on that long Tre pound, flame throwin'
Now isn't this a beautiful day, look up
It's Angel skies in Pelican Bay
Surprise nigga we all dying,
It's quiet after niggas get blast on


Niggas get shooting at me, I'mma come back
I ain't let shit die down, I'ma come back
I don't give a fuck who outside when I comeback
Nigga don't go fucking with me if you don't want that

Niggas get shooting at me, I'mma come back
I ain't let shit die down, I'ma come back
I don't give a fuck who outside when I comeback
Nigga don't go fucking with me if you don't want that


I got a bad Dominican bitch, built like Buffy the body
Got a new coke connect, my mexican little mommy
Got a plan for the cops in the raincoat
Automatic shotgun banging I spray some
Look, I got an NBA bitch, see me ballin'
She pull up in that Bentley only 4 in the morning
I fuck like it's my last peice of pussy I'm on it
Bitch like Jiffy with the lube she want it
Suck the lights out me, I mean the life out me
I like the way she through it, like ain't nothing too it
Now nigga don't you dare trip over no bitch
After money, that's the number one reason to get hit
Fuck around
