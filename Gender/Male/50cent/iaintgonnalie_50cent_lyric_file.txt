And I ain't gonna lie, girl, I just wanna, I just wanna

I can take you to Dinner, girl,
But I ain't gonna lie, I just want to fuck you, baby
We can go to the movies, girl,
But I ain't gonna lie, I just want to fuck you, girl
I can take you to shopping, girl
But I ain't gonna lie, I just want to fuck you, baby
I can keep your head up, girl,
But I ain't gonna lie, I just want to fuck you, baby

I really wanna get to know you, girl, so many things I wanna show you, girl
Succeed so I guess I owe you, girl. Louboutins, moving on
First the sun comes up and the top comes down, find out what the white rolls royce about
Why the white airs on extra clean, like james brown a nigga do it like a sex machine
Got a hot wheel fetish, I pull up in some mean shit
Sex, drugs, rock n roll, charlie sheen bitch
See me toot it and boot it on my Obama shit, money ain't no, tell them how much I'm a get
I spit bars had the hood in the frenzy, fuck around, take a chain like Lindsay
Paparazzi taking pictures of my fendy, catch me in Prada or maybe Escada
It's just another beautiful day in LA and I'm in New York, a professional shit talker
I see niggas are stressing and I'm straight so I'm guessing I'm above the recession.

I can take you to Dinner, girl,
But I ain't gonna lie, I just want to fuck you, baby
We can go to the movies, girl,
But I ain't gonna lie, I just want to fuck you, girl
I can take you shopping, girl
But I ain't gonna lie, I just want to fuck you, baby
I can keep your head up, girl,
But I ain't gonna lie, I just want to fuck you, baby

It takes just a little bit of my conversation when I talk
To make you clear for sure that I'm that nigga in New York
Shawty now lay down, put your head back
I put your legs back strocking move your bed back
When we get to them back shots, shawty throw it back
When you back it up at me I like that
Let me guess I turned you on, I turned you on, I bet
We're just getting started and everything is soaking wet
This pussy's good, she ain't worried about the rent this month
This pussy must have went and bought this bitch that benz out front
For me it's nothing, I'm just fucking for the fuck of it
But shawty acting like what we just did some other shit
It can be, it could be, okay, maybe she's a good girl
Attracted to me and things from my world
Temptations are great, one ten of braces that will ain't caress caries for 10 times 8.

I can take you to Dinner, girl,
But I ain't gonna lie, I just want to fuck you, baby
We can go to the movies, girl,
But I ain't gonna lie, I just want to fuck you, girl
I can take you to shopping, girl
But I ain't gonna lie, I just want to fuck you, baby
I can keep your head up, girl,
But I ain't gonna lie, I just want to fuck you, baby
