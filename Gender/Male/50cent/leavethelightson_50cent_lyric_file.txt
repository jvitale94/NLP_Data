Come to the freak show

Fuck that, leave the lights on
Girl, 68-69 leave the lights on
Can't see shit leave the lights on
Girl, I can't see shit leave the lights on
Girl, leave the lights on
68-69 leave the lights on
Damn, leave the lights on
Zip down my zipper and play with the python

Girl I make the bed rock like I'm on a yacht
Shit citation tink prick lick my cock baby
Time's money check my turbion movement
I'm rich bitch, I say move, you get to moving
And now my Bentley moves on, tight nigga I'm crusing
It ain't hard to tell who's running, who's loosing
Got a pent house around my wrist, I'm flashing out
Condo around my neck, I'm cashing out
I'm nigga rich, got everything a rich nigga get
I got whip for days, I got kick for days
Louie, Hermes', hard the Jimmy Choo's
Ferogamo, Dolce Gabana, red bottom blues
Plus I got the Prada collection
I might leave my socks on sex on old habbits
Babe show me what you know
Let the freak in you come out on the low

68-69 all the time, shorty
You can be a freak for me
Come and be a freak for me
Baby I can make girls lick my shorty

Attention shit, leave the lights on
Damn, leave the lights on
Zip down my zipper and play with the python

Girl I never known all that S&M shit
Girl leave the spikes for me but you can get your ass whiped
Limited time, skip the foreplay
I be a chocolate whopper you could have this shit your way
Hope the head games good you be looking exotic
Seven hour flight she already 'rotic
London, Paris, France, Japan
Talk to me girl while we fuck, I can't understand
Let's get to stroking, boning, moaning, groaning
Start in the afternoon, end up the next morning
Started the next round, lick from my neck down
So she did do felatio correct. Wow!
I'll play monkey see, monkey do
So everything you do to me I do to you
It tickles but I am quite here
What the fuck she tryna say with her tongue stuck in my ear

68-69 all the time, shorty
You can be a freak for me
Come and be a freak for me
Baby I can lick yours and you can lick mine shorty
You can be a freak for me
Come and be a freak tonight
This kid right, leave the lights on
Attention shit, leave the lights on
Damn, leave the lights on
Zip down my zipper and play with the python

Girl girl I know you want me
Well why the hell wouldn't you want me?
Shorty now push up on it
Zip down my zipper, play with the python
