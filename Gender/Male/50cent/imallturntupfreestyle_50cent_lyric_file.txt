I got that 64 Regal sittin' on 20? rims
Got that Beamer that Bentley
I got that 63 Benz
And a white bitch to suck dick like tomorrow's the end
Call her head game the Hoover I mean the way she maneuver
Up and down, up and down, and a nigga head spin 'round
She's a fellatio pro, I get off watching her go
She get to takin' it deep, and put a nigga to sleep

Party poppin' she goin' drop it she ain't stoppin'
Sittin' watchin' system knockin' hips rockin' pussy poppin' tic-toc-in
