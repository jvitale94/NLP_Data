Have a little faith
Oh you ought to know who you are
Oh we're all children
We're all human, we're all breathing
We're all needing, more than, what their giving
Can't you feel it?
The space of what's missing


You look up and they tell you it's a godless sky, a godless sky
So you look down
Cause you've convinced yourself
That this is all you've got, all you've got


But picture four billion hearts beating with you, with ours
Picture four billion faces that high for love
If there's one thing about this world I know
It's that we're in it, together
You're not alone, I'm not alone
If there's one thing about this world I know
We're together, we're together

I love you
And I don't know you
But I know the light in you
Is the same as in me
I trust you, like a brother
Cause you could understand the pain
Better than someone who's going through it


You look up and they tell you it's a godless sky, a godless sky
But don't you look down
Don't you convince yourself
That this is all you've got, all you've got


Just picture four billion hearts beating with you, with ours
Picture four billion faces that high for love
If there's one thing about this world I know
It's that we're in it, together
You're not alone, I'm not alone
If there's one thing about this world I know
We're together

I've searched the souls of my people
For something to believe in
Oh not words that I could say
But I heard them, I heard them


Just picture four billion hearts beating with you, with ours
Picture four billion faces that high for love
If there's one thing about this world I know
It's that we're in it, together
You're not alone, I'm not alone
If there's one thing about this world I know
We're together
