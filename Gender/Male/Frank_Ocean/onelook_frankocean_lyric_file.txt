

I've seen it and I liked it more
I told myself I had to have it
I look but I do not touch
Wondering why you walk like that (that that that)
There was something in those jeans
Locked up
It was dying to be free
And it was bound to happen
Ohhhh

Didn't have a pick up line to use
Way to cool, way too cool
Ohh whoa whoa ohh
And instead I'm hoping you're watching me too
Like I watched you

It took one look
Ohhh 
Just that one look
Ohhh 
What was I to do but look
Ohhh didn't stop staring
Ohhh couldn't run away from you
No, didn't stop
No  just took on look

That's a good look baby (baby)
That's a good look darling
That's a good look, good look
That's a good look

My eyes must have been on drugs
You calling me, check me so crazy
I couldn't see the floor beneath you
But baby I could see you pacing on
Thin air, mid-air, no
Long brown hair swinging, no
Red bottoms in your high heels
Like I'm watching a bluray

You?
Didn't know what to say
I'm way too cool, way too cool
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
And I, you know I'm hoping you're watching me too
Oh yeah, you know it's true

It took one look
Ohhh 
Just that one look
Ohhh 
What was I to do but look
Ohhh didn't stop staring
Ohhh couldn't run away from you
No, didn't stop
No  just took on look

I wanna stare at you some more
When I can feel you in my soul
I'm not looking from the outside
I could feel you?
I wanna grab that body
Touching that booty
Feeling on your booty
Say that you love it
And you said it's all mine

It took one look
Ohhh 
Just that one look
Ohhh 
What was I to do but look
Ohhh didn't stop staring
Ohhh couldn't run away from you
No, didn't stop
No  just took on look

It took one look
Ohhh 
Just that one look
Ohhh 
What was I to do but look
Ohhh didn't stop staring
Ohhh couldn't run away from you
No, didn't stop
No  just took on look

That's a good look baby (baby)
That's a good look darling
That's a good look, good look
That's a good look

That's a good look baby (baby)
That's a good look darling
That's a good look, good look
That's a good look
