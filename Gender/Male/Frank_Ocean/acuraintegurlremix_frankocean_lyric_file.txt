You know you're my bad, you know you're my baby, ooh
You know you're my bad, you know you're my baby, ooh
You know you're my bad, you know you're my baby, ooh

She's singing bitch I'm paid, that's all I gotta say, I'm like who knew?
After all the years I'd make a Weezy fan out of you too, you too, you too
When I met you, you were Thom Yorke, Chris Martin and U2, U2, U2
When you met me I was Three 6, Pimp C, Bun B, 8Ball and MJG, yeah

But we're both a long way from home
We got the windows down, the radios on, on

You know you're my bad, you know you're my baby, ooh
You know you're my bad, you know you're my baby, ooh

While I drive through the city, top down in the rain
I put you through it all can't fathom the pain
Them other chicks left just as fast as they came
But the love that I had for you, that will remain
Still I know how hard it is
It's kinda hard to forgive when it involves a kid
But nothing worth having comes easy so girl let's all be...
If the shoe fits you should lace it
As a man I shouldn't have put you them through certain situations
But you here for the ride
My life's a rollercoaster, be prepared for the ride
I walked the clouds for you and write your name in the sky
So everytime I look up you're right there in my eyes, right there in my eyes
F all them haters and them jealous chicks
I know you're my baby, don't need a DNA test to tell you this

I wrote a letter to the sky saying maybe one day you'll get to kiss me, kiss me, kiss me
My girl found it in the car and said baby why you trying to diss me, diss me, diss me
Cause you know you're my bad, you know you're my baby, ooh
I'm not just in it for the ride, in it for the ride, yeah

I know damn well she ride for me
It's all good, get high with me
Take everything that's stressing you and roll it up and smoke it
While them other chicks is angry, you stay happy and we love it
Take your clothes off and roll over
Lick between your legs til it's all over, my face
We keep going through these rumours, bitch you keep assuming
You know I love you, when trouble fumbles I keeps it moving
But I come right back cause I can't leave my baby like dat
Took my heart gave it back, Santa's home here's my lap
But sometimes I'm thinking maybe she be cheating
Not my baby the sex is so addictive, I'm going crazy coming back like

You know you're my bad, you know you're my baby, ooh
You know you're my bad, you know you're my baby, ooh
You know you're my bad, you know you're my baby, ooh
You know you're my bad, you know you're my baby, ooh
You know you're my bad, you know you're my baby, ooh
You know you're my bad, you know you're my baby, ooh
