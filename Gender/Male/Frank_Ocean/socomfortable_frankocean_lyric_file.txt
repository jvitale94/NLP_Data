

I’m afraid to say it
Don’t wan’t you to think I’m playing
My mistakes take the pretentiousness down like I’m standing naked
Hear the crowd and I sorry I know that I’m wrong yeah I’m wrong
If I could I’d go back I’m exposed give me back my clothes cause I just can’t take it
But look at you, loving a fool, making it easy
I guess its cool naked with you already seen me

Oh you got me so comfortable
Even when I’m wrong, comfortable
You don’t mind them flaws, you’ve already seen them all
Still got me feeling so comfortable
Feeling so comfortable

You keep on forgiving
Rewrote all my wrongs in pencil
When you stay it makes me forget that I’m down, now it’s all so simple
Till the end, even when, I look dumb like I do when I lie
Feels so good letting go I’m exposed, you can have my clothes cause I’m not afraid
But look at you loving a fool, making it easy
I guess it’s cool naked with you already seen me



It don’t matter it don’t matter no, you’ve seen it all before
It don’t matter it don’t matter , you’ve seen it all before
It don’t matter it don’t matter no, you’ve seen it all before
So comfortable, so comfortable, so comfortable
