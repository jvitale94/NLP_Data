That October night
The 29th, I almost lost my life
Call myself being the hero
Tryna guard your heart
No matter how hard I fought
It was over before it started
I thought that we were

On the same side of the battle, oh
I'm on the front line of disaster now
All make sense, I've put it together
Guess what we have doesn't matter oh

You have me dying
Every night, just because
You have me fighting
Every night, to prove my love
Cause we never get enough of fighting
In the club, I'm dying for your love
I don't know what you want
You got me fighting
Every night, to prove my love

All I ever did was
Just try to play my part
Try to be the man who would not let you get taken advantage of
But you let it go on
And every time I see you with him
I wanna crack his dome
Tell me that I'm wrong
But I thought we were

On the same side of the battle, oh
I'm on the front line of disaster now
All make sense, I've put it together
Guess what we have doesn't matter oh

You have me dying
Every night, just because
You have me fighting
Every night, to prove my love
Cause we never get enough of fighting
In the club, I'm dying for your love
I don't know what you want
You got me fighting
Every night, to prove my love

You got me dying.... fighting every night
Dying.... fighting every night

You have me dying
Every night, just because
You have me fighting
Every night, to prove my love
Cause we never get enough of fighting
In the club, I'm dying for your love
I don't know what you want
You got me fighting
Every night, to prove my love

On the same side of the battle, oh
