Every time that we're alone!
Girl, let's do some new,
Baby tell me where you wanna go,
So much opportunity
The many possibilities I know
When we'll be sexing,
Cause you'll never know
Where will be sexing, girl!

I can't wait till you get off
So, so I can put it on you,
I've been thinking about you all day,
You got the kind of love,
Make a nigger spend it on ya!
She ain't like 'em other girls,
She ain't like 'em other girls,
We'll be all upon the couch
We'll be all upon my dresser,
We'll be all upon my bed,
Know shawty ain't scared!

We just do it any day; we're just do it anyway,
We just do it anyway; we're just do it anyway!
In the back seat of my car, oh no, she don't mind!
We'll be all up in your office, put in that over time!
We just do it anyway!
We just do it anyway!
We just do it anyway!
We just do it anyway!

We just do it anywhere!
We just do it anywhere!
We just do it anywhere!
We just do it anywhere!
