

If a tree fell in the forest
And no one was around to hear it
Baby, does it go boom?
Does it go boom?
If I have love for ya
But you were never close enough to feel it
Is my love any good?
Is my love any good?
Oh...

But the distance ain't even a room away
You're laying in the bed right next to me
But there might as well be a brick wall in between us
Some soundproof glass
And some bars in the middle
Oh baby, when I wanna talk to you
I'm conversing with bricks and steel
A pile of bricks and steel
And when I tap your shoulders
You're cold as bricks and steel
A pile of bricks and steel

And how do I stay in love with you
Ravish all the the leftovers and garbage
Was it ever real
If you were never here?
Bricks and steel, walk around the kitchen
Like a pile of bricks and steel...
Bricks, bricks
Steel, steel...

I know you're somewhere in there...
Sometimes I wanna pick up a hammer
And start chiseling away, away...
Chiseling away, away...
Girl my phone bill is crazy
The rate is sky high when I call ya
But you only let it ring
You only let it ring, no ohh...

But the distance ain't even a room away
You're laying in the bed right next to me
Oh but there might as well be a brick wall in between us
Some soundproof glass
And some bars in the middle
Oh baby, when I wanna talk to you
I'm conversing with bricks and steel
A pile of bricks and steel
And when I tap your shoulders
You're cold as bricks and steel
A pile of bricks and steel

And how do I stay in love with you
Ravish all the leftovers and garbage
Was it ever real
If you were never here?
Bricks and steel, walk around the kitchen
Like a pile of bricks and steel
Bricks, bricks
Steel, steel...

Stomp, stomp
I think I hear 'em coming down the hall
He don't hear a word I say at all
I'm wishing these 4 walls could talk, talk...
Oh, stomp, stomp
I think I hear 'em coming down the hall and
He don't hear a word I said ohh, ohhh ohhh...

Oh baby, when I wanna talk to you
I'm conversing with bricks and steel
A pile of bricks and steel
And when I tap your shoulders
You're cold as bricks and steel
A pile of bricks and steel

And how do I stay in love with you
Ravish all the leftovers and garbage
Was it ever real
If you were never here?
Bricks and steel, walk around the kitchen
Like a pile of bricks and steel...
Bricks, bricks
Steel, steel...
