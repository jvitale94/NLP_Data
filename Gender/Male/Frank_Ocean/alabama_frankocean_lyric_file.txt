I was writing out everything, don't tell nobody
Something is out and he told me
Sleeping on my back, my body would wake up after me
My brother fresh out the penitentiary
The alcohol was stinging me
My four cousins stayed with me, stayed with us
Mom was in the shower, my aunt in law come over to fuck
So she get out in cut offs and a wife beater
 braless, titties swinging, she was seventeen and
(... In Reebok classics)
(Take the bully on after classes)
Her name was  we was cool after
 in Air Maxes
Fucked behind with road rashes
Lost the virgin on an air mattress
Tension rising, feeling unnatural
It's what I will do just to show you
That it's special now


What could I do to know you better than I do now?
What can I do to love you more than I do now?
What can I do to know you better?
What can I do to show my love?
What can I do to know you better?
What can I do? What can I do?
