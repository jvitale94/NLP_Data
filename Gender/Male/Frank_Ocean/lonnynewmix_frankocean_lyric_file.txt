I know I've been gone
I know it's been so long
And girl I hope you missed me
Cause you know I've been missing ya baby, missing my baby
Though we talk on the phone everyday But that just don't do it for me
I need ya around me
I can't be without you
Shorty my plane just now touched down I'm a send a car to come get you from your house
So be ready in a hour
Just be ready

We only got one night
The suns gone be setting in awhile. (You ready?, ready)
We still got moonlight
I'm down for whatever right now. (You ready?, ready)
Oh when the sky starts,sky starts changing
Sweet love we'll be making, ohhh
Just tell me (You ready, ready)

Open up the door
Girl you got me throwed off
Cause whenever you kiss me, girl
You can feel my heart beat, nooo
Look into your eyes, pretty waves of brown
If you only knew what I'm thinking about
But now you're right here, ohh
And now it's so real
Shorty my plane leaves at 9 A.M tomorrow
But between then and now we came to fuck, ohhh

We only got one night
The suns gone be setting in awhile. (You ready?, ready)
We still got moonlight
I'm down for whatever right now. (You ready?, ready)
Oh when the sky starts,sky starts changing
Sweet love we'll be making, ohhh
Just tell me (You ready, ready)

Hey yo!
We got one, yo!
We got one, yo!
We got one hey yo!
Ohh, baby I'm a take it slow
I dont' wanna let you go, never let go
Ohh, I know you been patient
Been waiting for this moment
Right here, right now!
