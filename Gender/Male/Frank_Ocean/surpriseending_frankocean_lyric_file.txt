You covered both of my eyes
(Mix-match text messages, voicemail evidence)
The audience yellin', "Damn, she's blind."
Now it's all so clear
And I was also not scared
(Now I know she missed stunt double skipped on it)
Audience kept yellin', "Not the space


(I could say that I knew the whole time) But I would be lyin'
(You'd have to be a hidden camera) Recordin' each take of cryin'
(I would say that I would just go to your part) To stop the taping
(But the end's here) And I can't change it


The suspense is buildin'...
Sittin' on edge of my seat now...
What's the surprise? What's the surprise? What's the surprise?
While the plot was thickenin'...
I was hangin' off the cliff love...
You said it's a surprise! What's the surprise... ending?


You didn't notice the signs
You thought I'd just let it slide
(Guess you kept missin' it Homeboys visitin')
The audience yellin', "Yeah, that's right."
And now it's not so clear
You don't know how you missed me (Gone)
Gone while you were gone
Stopped goin' through your phone
The audience yellin', "'Bout damn time."

Everything was okay when I was the victim...
Had me made out to be so naive...
Never knew I was workin' on a masterpiece...
So by the time you thought you had me, yeah...
I worked on my grand finale, yeah...
So now as the credits roll...
You're shocked to find out how it all unfolds...

(Endin'... Endin'... No...)
You didn't notice the signs...
You thought I'd just let it slide...
Yeah...
