Dopeman Nikes, George Costanza
Nigga it's colonic when I vomit
Get in niggas ass
You's a fag just for thinking gay
Nigga you ain't Andre
Better get an Hors D'ouvre, nigga you a cold sore
Lips of a prostitute, buff ass nigga
Having trouble with the childproof, nigga outlined you
Don't make me go back to that, nigga on a mongoose
Rest in peace Ron Gook, sitting in a old school
Smoking on some Goku, buds like Dragon Balls
Tequila with the lime juice, times two cyborgs
Smoking on some grapefruit, hoes come twice
But it's three if I eat the cooch
Peach coupe, no roof
When my hoes coming through
My bitches rap better than you
So quit worrying about what I'm gon' do
Cause I could give a flying fuck about what you doin'
I'm shooting moves...


So nigga quit worrying, about what I'm doing
Cause I could give a flying fuck about what you doing
My nigga I'm shooting moves...
So nigga quit worrying, about what I'm doing
Cause I could give a flying fuck about what you doing
My nigga I'm shootin' moves

Used to wait for the Dexter, smoking on that Newport
Stacks in the phone posit, work in the Jansport
Prayin for a personal, every time I go to court
Eastland shopping bag, ho's at the food court
Around the time you got your sounds put in that mammoth
I was on Clairmount, 3 for 10 slangin'
Shining like the silver on a Air Max '95
Took this rap shit serious about in '05
Got these niggas scared, ask them if I'm lyin'
Because I shit on niggas bar for bar without trying
Ain't in your top three? Then bitch you can't count
Only thing that makes sense is dollar amount
Ounce to the face, stank go to waste
You still tryna find a place to record your mixtape
...this ain't here for ya
Even Jesus tried to break the teeth for droppin' vocals
