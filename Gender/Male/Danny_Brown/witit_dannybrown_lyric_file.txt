But I don't know no Diddy, but got that Dirty Money with me
Got some Bobby and that Whitney for Christina and Brittney
She sippin' then she get tipsy then she drop it low and get get it


She wit' it I'm wit' it
She wit' it I'm wit' it
She wit' it I'm wit' it
It's mine she don't get it


Fuck all night when I'm on that E, shoulda popped 2 but tonight popped 3
Roll so hard can't feel my knees, 5 in the morning ain't think about sleep
Smoking on that papaya, got a white bitch looks like Mariah
Bet I make her hit that high note when I put this dick up inside her
My outerwear be Moncler, Bonjour, out there
Insane with Balmain, bitch these jeans about a stack a pair
Got henny stains on Givenchy, bitch don't even tempt me
I will take you to my office, make you give me that Lewinsky
Ball so hard when I'm on them 'ralls
Bitch so freaky suck a dick through the drawers
Halls in her mouth just to hum on the balls
After this night whore I won't even call
Up so high I ain't never gone fall
Pissin on niggas got careers in the stall
Shittin on niggas, leaving streaks in your drawers
Take your top off like a toilet when it's clogged


They say I'm a menace I meant it, I meant it
Be more than just a minute
This dick touch your appendix
I said that I'mma do it
So guess what bitch I did
These hoes know that I've done it
So now these bitches wit' it
She wit' it I'm wit' it
She wit' it I'm wit' it
She wit' it I'm wit' it


She rubbin' all on them titties like my name was Biggie
But I don't know no Diddy
I got that Dirty Money with me
Got some Bobby and that Whitney
For Christina and Brittney
She sippy then she get tipsy
Then she drop it low and get get it
She wit' it I'm wit' it
She wit' it I'm wit' it
She wit' it I'm wit' it


I go stupid, I be fooling
Bitch you see me, ho start drooling
Bitch you thirsty, acting foolish
Eazy on the E cause I’m ruthless
Nigga with an attitude when I ain't zooted
Roll a whole box up, let’s get clueless
You wanna eat her while I fuck you?
Waka waka, oh lets do it
Hard in the paint, think I ain’t?
Double cup love pouring up drank
Dirty cream soda, Swishers and doja
Dipping that molly gotta nigga tore up
Give yo monkey this banana
I make the camel toe trample
Got you dripping, wetting that bed up
When that pussy getting dismantled
I’m suckin all on them titties
You playing wit this dick
You put them legs up on my shoulders
I’m spittin all on that clit
She say “Oh, you so nasty”
“Oh Danny, you so nasty”
I’m slapping on that booty
Left my hand print on ya ass cheek


They say I'mma menace
I meant it when I’m in it
Be more than just a minute
This dick touch yo appendix
I said that I’mma do it
So guess what bitch I did it
Them hoes know that I done it
So now them bitches wit it
