Standing in the kitchen with a noose and a rifle
Hang or bang hockin' lugees in a bible
Dancing with the Devil tonight's our first recital
His hands on my hips he take control of my movement
A couple of minutes pass and I don't know what I'm doin'
Just dance to the music so nobody will laugh at me
But the fucking voices in my head keep asking me
Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight
You ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight
Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight
You ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight


I live all over my roomie's a bum
Fuck a bitch never sober virgin bitch nun
Sound like she dying when that virgin bitch cum
My used penis beats on this virgin bitch drums
She askin' me to dance I ask for my pants
Ended up with an arguement sirens, ambulance
Scratch her off my list, situation bias
She made me a milkshake and forced me to try it
Nah I ain't Nas get the fuck off my dick
Besides from the smell of it I'm hatin' the flavor
Last night for the hell of it I raped her neighbor
Bit her fillin's all through my vampire teeth saber
(Ahh, Jesus, please) She screams for her savior
A nun with a bum fuck you bitch better pay up
I need to eat, place to sleep, new shoes, aging feet
Alligator hair heat Gatorade made her sweet


Bitter sweet seven fist fightin' with a reverend
Bless sessions niggas fresh as Crest breath is
Devil in my chest I inhale more cess then
Place one missed call to heaven
You ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight
