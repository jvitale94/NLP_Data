 I'm in the mood for something wild and obscene
 I hear dat, I'm gettin tired of the same ol' routine
 I need some drama
 Oh, here I come L
 Tattoos and dim lights
 Black young niggette want you's to get it right
 Huh, that's all I need, we got two mouths to feed
 You talkin about some love
 To the six indeed, so uhh
Lay back and let'cha Daddy do it
 A real mack stay on track, he got the run
 Right through it



 Doin it and doin it and doin it well (Doin it)
Doin it and doin it and doin it well (Doin it)
Doin it and doin it and doin it well (Doin it)
 I represent Queens, she was raised out in Brooklyn




 I slowed it down cos we was amplifore
 Halfway
 All the way
 Now ya gettin 
 Raw to the ----, sick wit it
 Ain't to proud to beg, boy
 That's why I had to hit it, uhh
I'm in the zone gettin bedrooms props
I'm talkin outside scenarios
 Ac's
 And parking lots
 Word! You goin there, can-back seats and wild treats
Daddy do his thing mmm
 It's part of my mystique (He huh huh)
 I'm havin visions on sunsets and waterfalls
Your hands are in the air, you're up against the wall
 what you lookin for? Point it out
 Promise I'ma get it, send it to me
 Right away (?rule?) wanna hit it





 I need that new Benz, you in it, testin my limits
Laid back, cut, now I twist some lyrics
 Sharin cream like it's love, I'm ready now
 What you say when I put it on, you lovely girl
 Oww! You can never hesitate to do your thang (True!)
Although you come from Queens, I'ma treat you like a king
 Where you from?
 Brooklyn
 Honey-coated, in front of genius
 Gettin ------ in the 'lacs
 Tell me why you never wanna see your ex again?
 Hey Lover, you separate the Boyz from the Men
 That's a fact!
 It's well known why you lick your lips
 Yeah, blowin bubbles in blup-blup-blup
You makin me wonder if doin it's everything it seems
 You make me shiver
 Standing up in ya straight and then I lean
 Tell me here, I love it when ya way up in my mix
 Everything is butter in the 9-to-the-6
