Put your goddamn hands together for Public Enemy number one!


That’s the way we gonna do it
And that’s the way we gonna get through it


We the people can we get together?
Hell yeah
Can we get together we the people?
Oh yeah
See the people are they free and equal?
Hell no
Can we get from me to we my people?
We don’t know


Don’t you know


Here we come
From another time
We be family

Might disagree
The deaf can’t hear it
The blind can’t see
Dumb is relative
Blind can’t see
We all relatives
Human family
No I in team
But who we be?
Thinking how we’d be
From me to we


We the people can we get together?
Hell yeah
Can we get together we the people?
Oh yeah
See the people are they free and equal?
Hell no
Can we get from me to we my people?
We don’t know


Don’t you know
Here we come
Here we go
If you don’t know
I am the show
We get down
For the crown
Step by step
We build this town
Overseas
On the road
Die hard fans
At our show
How do we get from me to we?
Turn the M upside down
I mean and you will see


We the people can we get together?
Hell yeah
Can we get together we the people?
Oh yeah
See the people are they free and equal?
Hell no
Can we get from me to we my people?
We don’t know


It’s always for something
And something is nuttin’
