Hear the- Hear the- Hear the drummer get wicked
Hear the- Hear the- Hear the drummer get wicked
Hear the- Hear the- Hear the drummer get wicked


I’mma point a finger
And the fingers at you
I know what you did
And I know what you do
Flipping that news
Got the people confused
Abusin’ all the rhythm
Leaving us the damn blues
Wicked while you winnin’
While the rest of us lose
Nobody knowin’ just who
The fuck who
So I identify
I identify you
Those who know know who


Hear the- Hear the- Hear the drummer get wicked
Hear the- Hear the- Hear the drummer get wicked
Hear the- Hear the- Hear the drummer get wicked
Hear the- Hear the- Hear the drummer get wicked


Got a first and a middle
And a unknown name
Signed the dotted line
And charged your game
See they be lyin’
Nobody knows names
X the damn rhyme
In a low down shame
Pushing all the buttons
Pulling all the levers
You know who it is
It’s the so called devil
Beyond what you see
And now another level
Deeds of evil
Pick, ho, ax, shovel
Get to picking
While they politickin
Known all alone
In a room like quicken
Expose who they are
And what they do
Those who know know who


Hear the- Hear the- Hear the drummer get wicked
Hear the- Hear the- Hear the drummer get wicked
Hear the- Hear the- Hear the drummer get wicked
Hear the- Hear the- Hear the drummer get wicked
