Kinda hard to love a girl like me
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
I just wanted you to know
Swizz told me let the beat rock


For all my Southside niggas that know me best
I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex
Why? I made that bitch famous, God damn
I made that bitch famous
For all the girls that got dick from Kanye West
If you see em in the streets give em Kanye's best
Why? They mad they ain't famous, God damn
They mad they're still nameless, Talk that talk, man
Her man in the store tryna try his best
But he just can't seem to get Kanye fresh
But we still hood famous, God damn
Yeah we still hood famous


I just wanted you to know
I loved you better than your own kin did
From the very start
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
Maybach Music
I just wanted you to know


The furnace, fires, fortunes, and the fumes
The aura arrogance is been known to fill the room
Boom, little nigga who are you?
Roc-A-Fella Records on record to kill a crew
Vegas in my palms a don like the
Only one with beat taste from Kanye on my momma stew
For the ye I've been known to be Karmaloop
Malcom X in his head say my name and here come to troops
Hands out my pocket I cock it and let it loose
And Dame was spilling I'm Adele on a nigga boots
Martin Luther King's real estate was a dream
Farrakhan's farm was one that I once seen
The final call dogs stay on your dean
Fragrances Agent Provocateur stay on my queen
Mind your business the killers can intervene
I'm half naked in the GQ magazine
Tours looking like its wrestlemania
I'm The Rock setting fires to the stadium
Burn it down then I'm off to anther beat
Might get engages to a freak just for a couple weeks
Something I can't afford
If you not a playboy that's something I can't endorse
Win, lose, or draw William living like he Biggie Smalls
Balling its tax season I was born to be a boss
See that your face froze
Bobby Brown lockjaw, Whitney Houston in the ghost
Coogie and Cartier causalities of the fame
Your bitch MCM she even tagging my name


Bam bam, bam bam
Bam bam dilla, bam bam
Ey what a bam bam
How you feeling right now? Let me see your lighters in the air
Bam bam dilla, bam bam

One thing you can't do is stop us now
Bam bam, bam bam
Bam bam dilla, bam bam
You can't stop the thing now
Ey what a bam bam
Man it's way too late, it's way too late, it's way too late you can't fuck with us
Bam bam dilla, bam bam

To the left, to the right

Ey what a bam bam
Bam bam, bam bam

I just wanted you to know
I loved you better than your own kin did
From the very start
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
I just wanted you to know
