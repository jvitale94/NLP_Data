It's that fly diabolical, come on
Let's go Ra, come on
I got to tell 'em, man, I got to tell 'em
Based on a true story, y'all
Yeah... prophets, nigga, prophet


From the Hills of the Shaolin
All the Wu-Tang came, from far and wide
From the Hills, of the Shaolin
With an iron fist of fury and a mighty sword
To fulfill the prophecy of the Wu-Tang, of the Wu-Tang


In the Polo store, fronting in war clothes, it been like this
From right in time when I was nine years old
I was a hot mess, smoking cheeba, running with stolen speakers
Dropped beepers, even wore a victory vest
I run with niggas, digging knots from niggas, running out the school
Stunting, back of the bus, flashing the ox
Rock the V-Gooses, everything we wore was name brand
Sold three looseys, just to get on call plan
R.E.C. Poss' Rockers, the Blip Brothers
Even the Spin Doctors, sat and smoke blunts, I been bopping
All my kins blew up, we grew up with
We used to do what? Running through the sewers and then shopping
Pick pocket, deuce baby, take it in truce, baby
You know how we do, come run in my boots, baby
The niggas came through, touch the God, here Shallah
Ever since went from ninjas to gem stars, sing Ra


From the Hills of the Shaolin
All the Wu-Tang came, from far and wide
From the Hills, of the Shaolin
With an iron fist of fury and a mighty sword
To fulfill the prophecy of the Wu-Tang, of the Wu-Tang


Reunited, another LP, we're all excited
That reckless eyeballing will get your girl indicted
My touch like Midas, I cramp your style, arthritis
These niggas is food, I eat they food, nigga-ritis
Your man don't snooze, insomniac
This The W, the Clan don't lose, you putting hands on who?
Hands down, I can handle you, you half man, half animals
If you are what you eat, and eat pussy, you's a cannibal
And stopping me, is what you cannot do
Either get in the game, get out the way, or get ran right through
I ain't different Method Man like you
But you ain't like us, we play rough, my community tough
And little kids in my community cuss
Y'all be showing your guns, but the ones in my community bust
And when they do, you give the jewelry up


From the Hills of the Shaolin
All the Wu-Tang came, from far and wide
From the Hills, of the Shaolin
With an iron fist of fury and a mighty sword
To fulfill the prophecy of the Wu-Tang, of the Wu-Tang


All the niggas came through
Yeah, from the Hills, Park Hill, Shaolin
Stapleton, New Brighton, nigga
West Brighton, the Park, nigga
Wu-Tang, South Beach, nigga
Yeah, muthafucka, yo
