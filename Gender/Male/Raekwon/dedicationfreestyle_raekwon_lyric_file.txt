

Turn me up a little
All these Coo-Coo ass niggas around here man
Coo-Coo for crack motherfucking rocks huh

I'm from the land where niggas'll lay low
Them things'll blow, In the alley where the caves is home
Lighting gallons of bone, Every roosters immune to mad money
They want their niggas fly as balloons
So when the beat bump niggas get drunk
Play spades with the fiends
I gotta rifle team who blaze and thump
We want the moola to true line a new ride
All my dudes we got Pumas on, The blue single logic
It's me, Spaceship, Comfortable V
Catch me in France, I'm laying looking humble and free
Buying mad shit, Berta Cavalli hats
Furler jeans, Edmond Roth shirts, Burners and slacks
Come get it pussy, You want it then get down
I'm only respect'n whatever's from the door, Showing me style
Yall in love with all that bullshit
Hood niggas stay broke and fake rappers shine'n
What's under the wood shed, Raw talent
Masta polly, Come to the lab
I hook a steak up and write two ballads
