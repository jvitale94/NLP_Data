(Till the bitter end, till the bitter end)
Let's have a ball y'all, let's get it in
(Let's get it in, let's get it in)
It all goes down sweet till the bitter end
(Till the bitter end, till the bitter end)
Let's have a ball y'all, let's get it in
(Let's get it in, let's get it in)
And if it feels good baby just let me know
(Let me know, let me know)
And if it feels good baby just let me know
(Let me know, let me know)
I wanna do it for ya, I wanna do it for ya
I wanna do it for ya, I wanna do it for ya
I wanna do it for ya, I wanna do it for ya
I wanna do it for ya, I wanna do it for ya

Yeah, through the streets we parade like a second line
Game face, we charade hard to recognise
Lyrical we only set aside for better times
Put the roses in the vase while the guests arrive
Something for the repertoire, that was kept in mind
At the tip of my tongue if I could just describe
Unforgettable what Stella Artois provides
True bittersweet place that it occupies
Life's too short to embrace the brevity
It's a moment in time, why waste or bury it?
Image isn't anything but taste is everything
Every legendary when I create the recipe
I don't only make music, I make history
While I show the whole world love unconditionally
Icon against the harmonic symphony
You witnessing the definition of chemistry

It all goes down sweet till the bitter end
(Till the bitter end, till the bitter end)
Let's have a ball y'all, let's get it in
(Let's get it in, let's get it in)
It all goes down sweet till the bitter end
(Till the bitter end, till the bitter end)
Let's have a ball y'all, let's get it in
(Let's get it in, let's get it in)
And if it feels good baby just let me know
(Let me know, let me know)
And if it feels good baby just let me know
(Let me know, let me know)
I wanna do it for ya, I wanna do it for ya
I wanna do it for ya, I wanna do it for ya
I wanna do it for ya, I wanna do it for ya
I wanna do it for ya, I wanna do it for ya

Yeah, we put in work but when it's finished then it's leisure
I hear color, taste sound - synesthesia
It's complicated to break down, then it's easure
Of your weight round, you sure to be replenished
By the five different scientific measurements of seeds
Then that'll work with, come get your thirst quenched
I'm a craftsman with the tools in my workbench
Well I'ma play by the rules and bud this surface
The only limit is the sky, no ceiling
One thing's for sure, it's I know feeling
What doesn't feel right's what I won't deal in
If it's airtight then it's worthy of a seal
And you know it's a real one, that's when we in the building
Open the fence, pop the top on a chill one
I started as a trendsetter and I'm still one
So for the love and support thanks a million

It all goes down sweet till the bitter end
(Till the bitter end, till the bitter end)
Let's have a ball y'all, let's get it in
(Let's get it in, let's get it in)
It all goes down sweet till the bitter end
(Till the bitter end, till the bitter end)
Let's have a ball y'all, let's get it in
(Let's get it in, let's get it in)
And if it feels good baby just let me know
(Let me know, let me know)
And if it feels good baby just let me know
(Let me know, let me know)
I wanna do it for ya, I wanna do it for ya
I wanna do it for ya, I wanna do it for ya
I wanna do it for ya, I wanna do it for ya
I wanna do it for ya, I wanna do it for ya
