


I hear somebody screaming
Again bracing for the fall
Close my eyes but I never wonder
I have seen it all


They don't remember
Was it coming was it going
Running from the sun
Listen through the morning


I'm coming
Take my chance my footsteps in the road
No one sees and no one knows
I'm coming
I'm coming
I'm coming
