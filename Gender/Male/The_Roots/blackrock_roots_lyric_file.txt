Hey what's for breakfast?
Same as yesterday
Oh that's right cheeseburger and a 40 ounce
Hey, what's for dinner? Nothing nigga
But last night I had dreams of a porterhouse
Ay yo for real I feel like
Cattle in a slaughterhouse
But fuck that grow another here's a quarter ounce
It ain't no hydro, but it gets you high though
Them niggas look like casper what the fuck do I know


At the end of this tunnel, it's red and blue lies
Once you pay the price you can never do right
One thing I know all I did is wrong
Maybe there ain't nowhere I belong
The only thing in front of me is a bullet in the head
They hoping one day that they find me dead
Until then I make a place in this world
For me and my baby girl


Got the dead drop way until the A.M
Mumbo Jumbo niggas onomatopoeian
Call it how I see them ain't no rhyme or reason
I'm on some different bullshit everyday just like per diem
I damn with animal anguish
So love no bitch die richer than language
Guilty of sin depending on the reeds shaking in the wind
Just a question not an answer out here depending on its end
