If I bash her I'll probably would just shatter
Broken pieces that represent my heart
Broken pieces keep fallin from my heart

In the mirror I'm lookin at the shadow
If I bash her I'll probably would just shatter
Broken pieces that represent my mind
Broken pieces keep fallin from my heart

Cause I kno wat I'm feeling
And I kno wat is real
Broken pieces that represent my heart
Broken pieces keep fallin from my heart


Everyday when I wake up
I wanna see yo face and I
Realize that you'll never apologize
For yo lies and all the ways you hurt me
And I kno in my mind that you ain't worthy
But when I look in the mirror
I see this girl who keeps cryin she's cryin
She still in love with you
But I tell not to cause she's wildin she's wildin
I don't kno wat she's thinkin about
Get it together or I'm gettin you out
Of the mirror
I'm gettin you outta my system
My vision premonition
And I listen to my answers
And free my soul from prison




My patience a plastic bag
And he kept fillin it
Carryin baggage of others
Is where I emptied it
Played the fool before
I'm not about to let you enter
My mind for my heart draws the bigger picture
His presence embrace me
His lovin so greatly
I miss the way we
Use to sit up all night
And talk about nothin
On the phone
Please how could you be so weak
When you kno u deserve so much better
And rather than settle for less
Jus let the best play catch up
When the time is right they'll find you
If you choose to
Do not do
The best I could do
Is warn and inform you
The mirror
