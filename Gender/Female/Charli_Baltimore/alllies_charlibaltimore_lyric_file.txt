I think we had something true and it's all lies
A-a-a-all lies
Huh
And the plot thickens
See I'm a little too far in
Starring
Me and you the main attraction from the preview
I should've stopped then
I should've stopped when it was textin'
Just lovers with no name
But then I locked you in
Pic saved, face flashing on my screen
So naive, in a way I'm exactly what drama means
(Drama means)
Stop the folks from rocking
I see sickness
And this game you're playing blocking all the roads to fix this
Nice lawn, just laying,
4 a.m. telling me you're gonna stay in
But she got nothing I ain't giving you
I keep saying "fuck you"
But then you fuck me
I wind up fucking forgiving you

I'm through
Not another night
No more pretending
No more cliffhangers
I need a happy ending
I need a part two
I played my part too
We food a flesh so in love before I thought it through

Good bitch, cruel intentions
Ready to call her, email her pop and mentions
So gone for you, I been watching her tweets
She at and your kissy faces while I'm watching our sheets

Damn you just left for promises and breaking it off
Lies I believe so clothes, I'm taking 'em off
I know the truth hurts, deception flies through me
And so I know it's real, just lies

If I say I ain't fucking niggas, just say you ain't fucking bitches
(But it's false)
I think we had something true and it's all lies
I think we had something true and it's all lies
Na na na na
I said you're always coming home
And you say you won't go through my phone
(But it's false)
I think we had something true and it's all lies
I think we had something true and it's all lies
Na na na na


Look, I can read the signs but I'm scared to call it
Got a feeling in my gut, I already know it
Trying to ignore it but he feeling's getting worse
Cause you're moving kind of funny, now you got me on alert
Uh!
Claiming that this love, and this a happy home
But you went into the bathroom just to use the phone
Hoping that I'm wrong, knowing that I'm right
Cause all the signs sayin' you're fucking with a nigga, right? (right)
Like you ain't seen me calling you the other night
Like I ain't noticed lately you've been missing half the night
(Aw man)
You're playing with me bitch, you won't drive me mad
I ain't playing with you bitch, who brought this pain
It's the feeling in my soul that I can't avoid
Sayin' you cheatin' on me
You say I'm paranoid
You sent me what they do
I don't wanna fuck with you
(Nah)
Then I fuck you, than I end up being stuck with you
(Oh)
Tell me that you love me look me in the eye
(Look)
Playing that is true but you know it's probably lies
(Damn)
My homies keep on saying I should leave low
But I'm looking for a spot that I can live low
Caught in my emotions how it come to this
(How)
Got me searching through your stuff like I'm the bitch
Up and down, all around, roller-coaster
I know it's over, I guess I wanted closure

If I say I ain't fucking niggas, just say you ain't fucking bitches
(But it's false)
I think we had something true and it's all lies
I think we had something true and it's all lies
Na na na na
I said you're always coming home
And you say you won't go through my phone
(But it's false)
I think we had something true and it's all lies
I think we had something true and it's all lies
Na na na na

If I say I ain't fucking niggas, just say you ain't fucking bitches
(But it's false)
I think we had something true and it's all lies
I think we had something true and it's all lies
Na na na na
I said you're always coming home
And you say you won't go through my phone
(But it's false)
I think we had something true and it's all lies
I think we had something true and it's all lies
Na na na na
