Two thousand five
There will be no room for y'all with no originality, woo

You're the reason, I don't trust no one
And I don't love no one from the places, I've come
The sad songs, I've sung all the times, I've been stung
Boy you bring the worst out of me

And I can't, allow these tears, I've cried
The emptiness inside that left me so petrified
Tried to keep love alive but I became too tired
'Cause you bring the worst out of me

And, I wish I coulda changed the way, things have gone
And start life and do it now, maybe once again
I don't know when or where but somethin' must have went wrong
And all I have to say, is now

When I sing this song, I get so teary eyed
'Cause you get under my skin, can't let you suck me dry
I was gonna marry you, have kids for you
Stay true to you, live life with you
But look what you've done to me

I comprimised all my time
And rearranged my life, to make sure you was fine
'Cause our love was on the line and I became so unkind
'Cause you brought the worst out of me

This is, how the story goes
The others want to know, when it's out of control
You work and you work but someone gets hurt
And I guess that be me

When I sing this song, I get so teary eyed
'Cause you get under my skin, can't let you suck me dry
I was gonna marry you, have kids for you
Stay true to you, live life with you
But look what you've done to me

Yeah, I wish I coulda changed the way, things have gone
And start life and do it now and maybe once again
I don't know when or where but somethin' must have went wrong
And all I have to say

When I sing this song, I get so teary eyed
'Cause you get under my skin, can't let you suck me dry
I was gonna marry you, have kids for you
Stay true to you, live life with you
But look what you've done to me, yeah
