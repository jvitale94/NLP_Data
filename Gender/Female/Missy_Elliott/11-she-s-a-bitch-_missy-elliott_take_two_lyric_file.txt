To the M-I, cat like a semi
Nigga stole my car, why not you get my
Give yo' ass a black eye
Oh, say bye-bye
I'ma give your body to the sky
Run through your clique
Nigga, you pissed on trip
I'ma have to bust you in your lips
And the whips better have a whole lot of chips
Cause I ain't for no nigga givin' tips

She's a bitch
When you say my name
Talk mo' junk but won't look my way
She's a bitch
See I got more cheese
So back on up while I roll up my sleeves

She's a bitch
You can't see me, Joe
Get on down while I shoot my flow
She's a bitch
When I do my thing
Got the place on fire, burn it down to flame

Roll up in my car, don't stop, won't stop
I'ma keep in rockin' til the clock don't tock
I'ma keep it hot, light my ass on fire
I'ma grab a philly, go and roll it at the bar
What ya talk? What ya say? Huh?
Gotta flow, gotta move it slow, huh?
Better you runnin' out the door, huh?
You gon' be a long lost soul, whacha say?

Yippe yi yo, yippe yi yi yay
Put me on stage, watchin' niggas feel me
Put my shit on wax, watch it blaze like May
Go yippe yi yo yippe yi yi yay
55, 65, hike
75, 85, test the mic
95, Missy wild for the night
105, I'ma keep the crowd hyped

She's a bitch
When they say my name
Talk mo' junk but won't look my way
She's a bitch
See I got mo' cheese
Back on up while I roll up my sleeve

She's a
What? What? What? What?

Anybody know my skills, what the deal
Anybody feel my skills, it's the real
Anybody wanna come fuck wit us still
