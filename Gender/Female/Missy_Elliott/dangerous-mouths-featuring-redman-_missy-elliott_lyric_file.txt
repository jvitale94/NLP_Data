3000 baby, raunchy
Raunchy, raunchy
Raunchy, raunchy

Good riddance, to niggas and bitches bullshittin'
I house MC's like baths and full kitchens, ready or not
Doc, hood lynchin', icey flows, I write with wool mittens
It's two not one, Missy dot dot com
Come once in the blue like free hot lunch

So once it's on, turn it up, chickens flockin' in
Shoppin' at birds are us, murderous
Don't blame me, blame the music
I write with napalms in my hands, flame the fuses
Like ca psss, off you go

I'm nice battin', I practice when the park is closed
I'm that man who squats out of jeeps and vans
Jump from to roof to roof on a TV cam, I fuck a model
I go out with the cheapest tramps, pussy have me trippin'
Like Kima, Keisha, Pam

I remain cool like like open house on a school night
Animal House gettin' thrown out for food fights
PPP strictly don't give a fuck
An Brick City niggas strictly don't give a fuck

Let me intervene, come between, like dick through your jeans
Hang down to your knees, it's mwa the don-wan
Carry on, D.A.N to the danger
Y'all MC's in a whole lot of danger

Change up all your rhymes, you need beats
My beats you see completely unique, forgive thee
See it's the shots of Hennessey that's in me
Reggie Noble come through after me

It takes two to tingle and two to fuck
I done fucked in Range Roves to Isuzu trucks
Used to move weight, now you makin' moves to duck
Built solid without bolts, screws and nuts
Pussy tight jiffy lube it up, Doc came up, hoes use to hang up
Now my arm close hang 'em

My crew is deeper than Karl Kani pockets
We don't buy bullets, we ask what size rockets, for thee occasion
One shot will have you ravin'
Like Symone when the four four is blown
Two minutes later I'll make it hotter, snap you from the vine
To my [Incomprehensible] glada

So what you wanna do, what you wanna do?
Yo I got the chickens, the brew taken next a mushrooms
Def Squad in the house, bitch,  drop your drawers
Tell your boyfriend ease up and park his car

I'm from the south you better watch your mouth
It's the M.I, the S.I, if you try then you die
I don't take no mercy on you suckers so
Would you still be in love, baby?
If I cut your throat, cut the jokes

I ain't got no love for yo, no friends with those
Who imitate me ya bold
My style I own, I'ma have to steal your flow
You know me Joe
I ain't gotta say no more, bitch

That's right nigga
It's Misdemeanor here, Redman, Timbaland
Muthafucka, 3 triple zero, the Matrix baby, I'm out
