Throw Your Hands Up (Interlude)
[Lil' Kim]
Yo, this the Queen Bee
And I came to say a lil' sumpin'
On my girl Missy's shit
You see I got sumpin' to say
That's right, I got a problem
I got a problem with all y'all mutha' fucka's out there
That got a problem wit' us callin' ourselves a bitch
Yeah, that's right, I said it mutha' fucka
BITCH, what

You see, bitch is a strong word
And only strong bitches can use that mutha' fuckin' terminology
Bitch
I mean, if you can't wear the name
Don't try to use it, shucks

Throw your hands up if you like to get high
To make a phat beat so we can party all night
If you got beef you got to take it outside
Throw your wrists up and let me see your eyes shine
