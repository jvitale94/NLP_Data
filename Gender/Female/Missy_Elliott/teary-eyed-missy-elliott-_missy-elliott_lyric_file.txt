2005, there will be no room for y'all with no originality

You're the reason I don't trust no one
And I love no one from the places I've come
Sad songs I've sung, all the times I've been stung
For you bring the worst out of me

And I can't down these tears I've cried
The heaviness inside left me so petrified
Tried to keep love alive but I became too tired
'Cuz you bring the worst out of me
Eh, eh, eh, eh

I wish I coulda change the way things have gone
And start life anew and now, maybe once again
I don't know anywhere but somethin' must've went wrong
And all I can say

Is when I sing this song, I get so teary eyed
'Cuz you get under my skin, can't let you suck me dry
I was gonna marry you, have kids for you
Stay true to you, live life with you
But look what you've done to me, me

And I compromised all my time
And rearranged my life to make sure you was fine
'Cuz our love was on the line and I became so unkind
'Cuz you brought the worst out of me
(You brought the worst out of me)

This is, how the story goes
  (This is)
Those ones who know when it's out of control
You work and you work and someone gets hurt
And I guess that be me
(When I sing)

When I sing this song I get so teary eyed
'Cuz you get under my skin, can't let you suck me dry
I was going to marry you, kids for you
Stay true to you, live life with you
But look what you've done to me
Eh, eh, eh, eh

I wish I coulda change the way things have gone
And start life anew and now maybe once again
I don't know anywhere but somethin' must've went wrong
And all I can say
(When I sing)

Is when I sing this song I get so teary eyed
'Cuz you get under my skin, can't let you suck me dry
I was going to marry you, have kids for you
Stay true to you, live life with you
But look what you've done to me, yeah

The definition of mommy is not a chick with kids
Mommy means the boss, the money-maker, the man taker
The provider, the low [Incomprehensible] rider
So if you [Incomprehensible] mommy
