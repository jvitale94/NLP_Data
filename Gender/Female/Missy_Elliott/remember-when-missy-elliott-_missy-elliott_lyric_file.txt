Baby, it's not true when they say all men are dogs
'Cause I know a lot of women who cheat, I know you kinda wonder
Why I'm havin' this conversation with you 'cause I speak
Upon experience an' it's worth anything, I'll never cheat again

I know I may act stubborn, boy
But that don't mean I don't love you, boy
Please forgive me for my attitude
When it seems I'm takin' all my shit out on you

I know I never said this here
Let me make myself, loud and clear
I appreciate the way you treat me
I did a lot of things, you still don't hate me

Remember when you caught me cheatin', cheatin'
You said I stopped your heart from breathin', breathin'
But you loved me so much forgave me, forgave me
When you could've went out and played me, played me

Am I a disappointment to you baby? Most of the time I'm wrong
Makin' excuses for abuses I've done, steppin' all on your heart
But you never left me baby, say I'm sorry all the time
And any other guy would be gone but you stayin' right by my side

Remember when you caught me cheatin', cheatin'
You said I stopped your heart from breathin', breathin'
But you loved me so much forgave me, forgave me
When you could've went out and played me, played me

And a love like this and I can't play no games
And it's hard to forgive it but you didn't never complain
Didn't rub it in my face, just let me slide on by
I know that every girl, wish she had you as a guy

My, my, oh my, holla, no no, no no, no no, Lord
'Cause a love like this can't play no games
And it's hard to forgive, things I did to you
Let me slide on by, yeah have you ever

When I cheated, you said you couldn't breathe
Said you couldn't breathe
Now I'm sittin' here beggin' on my knees
Take me back, I'll do anythin' includin' plead

I didn't mean to burn a bridge three degree
Like Fantasia said, "Let yourself be free"
The truth be without me you'd succeed
I'm sorry baby, please believe in you and me

C'mon, it ain't no love, better than you
With all the pain I put you through
I've still [Incomprehensible]
And you still love me, yes you do

It ain't no love, better than you
With all the pain I put you through
I've still [Incomprehensible]
Without you here, what would I do

Remember when you caught me cheatin'
