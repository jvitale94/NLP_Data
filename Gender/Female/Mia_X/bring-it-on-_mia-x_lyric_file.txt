Remember me i tote a shoty
Military gunfare just one day
Paper weight hands and arrest leg

Brand new glock inventions and killers with bad intentions
Forget to mention don't mind my neck on the line
Give my moms the insurance money and card for valentines
I ain't died burn no coffin don't pour no cornie on me
Smoked in the zone stashed throw me taking what the owe me
I the soldier in the fatigues full of weed ready to bleed
Behind what i believe the tank and we indeed
Boy i hem thee the message with bent knees
And notes around they neck signed bitch fiend sent these

From the streets to the motherfucking cell block
If you with me cock it back and let them shells pop
If we gone die then we gone die letting off shots
Woah there nigga

And break your ass off with a 45 and a extra clip
They call me c-murder cause i put on in your dome
I come to your set and leave you laying at home
I hang with killers and dealers, weed smokers and g's
No limit niggas don't fall off so fuck my enemies
If i come from around the corner i'm a knock up your head
Shouldn't have been fucking with that nigga with the enuciation
Fucking with the nigga with bad attitude and bad pronunciation
That's why i come off rude, loud and obnoixous, every other word gone
Be
Profane
Farting, spiting, grabbing my dick like i ain't got no fucking home
Training
Even if it's 5 o'clock in the morning and the song ain't done i ain't
Leaving
I'll take all day but when i finish the bitch have your head hurting
And your
Ears bleeding
From having no money barely eating, not going no where rarely leaving
To steak and shrimp every evening, gone all day busy as a beaver
Imma soldier, told ya, now i'm a show ya

Doing it over
I got the end of the m-16 explode
You don't wanna, ain't gonna go to war
Shot to kill, forward march
