Uh, U N I T Y

Instinct leads me to another flow
Everytime I hear a brother call a girl a bitch or a ho
Trying to make a sister feel low
You know all of that gots to go
Now everybody knows there's exceptions to this rule
Now don't be getting mad, when we playing, it's cool
But don't you be calling me out my name
I bring wrath to those who dis-respect me like a dame

That's why I'm talking, one day I was walking down the block
I had my cutoff shorts on right 'cause it was crazy hot
I walked past these dudes when they passed me
One of 'em felt my booty, he was nasty
I turned around red, somebody was catching the wrath
Then the little one said, haa, haa, yeah baby bitch, and laughed
Since he was with his boys he tried to break fly
Huh, I punched him dead in his eye and said, "Who you calling a bitch?"

I hit the bottom, there ain't nowhere else to go but up
Bad days at work, give you an attitude then you were rough
And take it out on me but that's about enough
You put your hands on me again I'll put your ass in handcuffs
I guess I fell so deep in love I grew dependency
I was too blind to see just how it was affecting me
All that I knew was you, you was all the man I had
And I was scared to let you go, even though you treated me bad

But I don't want to see my kids see me getting beat
Down by daddy smacking mommy all around
You say I'm nothing without ya, but I'm nothing with ya
A man don't really love you if he hits ya
This is my notice to the door, I'm not taking it no more
I'm not your personal whore, that's not what I'm here for
And nothing good gonna come to ya 'til you do right by me
Brother you wait and see, who you calling a bitch?

What's going on in your mind is what I ask ya?
But like Yo-Yo, you don't hear me though
You wear a rag around your head and you call yourself a 'Gangsta Bitch' Now that you saw Apache's video, I saw you wilding, acting like a fool
I peeped you out the window jumping girls after school
But where did all of this come from?
A minute ago, you was a nerd and nobody ever heard of ya
Now you a wannabe, hard

You barely know your ABC, please
There's plenty of people out there with triggers ready to pull it
Why you trying to jump in front of the bullet, young lady
Uh, and real bad girls are the silent type
Ain't none of this work getting your face sliced
'Cause that's what happened to your homegirl, right?
She got to wear that for life, who you calling a bitch?
