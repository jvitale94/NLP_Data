Well good morning baby, welcome back to town
Well good morning baby, welcome back to town
You're doing so much traveling
Never know when you'll be around

Yes, you're a fine and mellow fellow
But you're stubborn as a mule
You love me like an angel
But you treat me like a fool

Two-faced Daddy
They don't hand me no double cross
'Cause anytime I'm ready
I can tell you baby get lost

Say, "You're cheating on the outside
Doing anything you choose
You better come back on the inside
'Cause you got too much to lose"

Don't want no trouble
Yeah, I've got to be the boss
And if you can't play it my way
Well now baby get lost
Hey c'mon

I try and stop your cheating
But I just don't have the time
I got so many men that
They're standing in line

Keep it cool papa
Hey you got to come across
'Cause any time I'm ready
I can tell you baby get lost
