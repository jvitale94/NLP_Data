Just another day living in the hood, just another day around the way
Feelin' good today, feelin' lovely yeah
Just another day living in the hood, just another day around the way
Feelin' good today, I hear the, but I'm here to stay

Well it's a beautiful day in the neighborhood
A beautiful day in the neighborhood
Can't go wrong, I feel strong and the flavor's good
I'm wit whatever comes my way, hip hop hooray

Latifah's on vacation, I'm just plain on day to day
I strap out, step out in every direction
Glock, techs, Jimmy hats, in case I need protection
So I land cruise from towns, play I wanna be's

A kid in the increase gettin' jack right in front of me
So I play the tech close my finger's on the trigger
Don't wanna get wet, so they step, 'cause mine's is slightly bigger
But better yet, I'ma threat, so ya better walk
Or get sketched out in chalk, 'cause I don't wanna talk

I stay true blue, I'm hopin' it's you too
I got the fever for the flava of a who who
So it's back to the block time to play
It's just another day around the way, hey

Just another day living in the hood, just another day around the way
Feelin' good today, feelin' lovely yeah
Just another day living in the hood, just another day around the way
Feelin' good today, I hear the, but I'm here to stay

Time to chill, hit the hill, uptown let's keep the sights
Shoot some pool, act a fool, 'cause it's on tonight
I'm doin' the knowledge, it's not easy, easy
Watchin' a cop cuff a kid for sellin' a clip to a D.T.

But it's home, so I flex, get pressures off my chest
Slip in a tape, now which hood should I hit next?
Stomachache, had a steak, and take for a bean pie
Get a final call from the brother in the bow-tie

I'm from little kid's dream and fiend for fun
Lots of laughter, moms, no pops playin' wit her son
I pass by a girl's wake, they say she died at seven
Hit by a stray, but I pray that there's a hood in heaven

Fake brothers claim there's no shame in their game
You know my name, show me a real nigga wit a brain
So it's back to the block time to play
It's just another day around the way, hey

Just another day living in the hood, just another day around the way
Feelin' good today, feelin' lovely yeah
Just another day living in the hood, just another day around the way
Feelin' good today, I hear the, but I'm here to stay

You know I gotta get props, I can't stop, without y'all
I be nothin', no wreckin', no checks, and no rhymin', no cuttin'
No stages from pages, no phones, no beepers
No reason to put Queen in front of the name Latifah

I come with the real live perspective in rule
'Cause me and my peoples around the way remain cool
So it's back to the block time to play
It's just another day, around the what, around the muthafuckin' way

Just another day living in the hood, just another day around the way
Feelin' good today, I'm feelin' lovely yeah
Just another day in the neighborhood, just another day around the way
Feelin' good today, I hear the, but I'm here to stay

Just another day living in the hood, just another day around the way
Feelin' good today, I hear the, but I'm here to stay, 'cause it's
Just another day in the neighborhood, just another day around the way
I'm feelin' good today, I'm feelin' lovely yeah

Feelin' good today, I'm feelin' good today
I know my hood's okay, it's gonna be okay
