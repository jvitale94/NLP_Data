

I'm a parrot
I'm robin this joint
Not a lyre bird
Sure ain't a vulture
Don't swallow that cause I make the culture
I'm not a lyre bird
Staying staying rich like an ostrich

Free up my love
Free up my love
Free up my love
Free up my love
Staying staying rich like an ostrich

Drop down get your eagle on
Like a falcon
Fly phenomena
Humming higher than a drone
Doves cry
Are you going home alone?
Squad flock
Migrate for the summer
Duck out for some hot weather
Birds of prey and I'm shaking off my feather
I believe like R. Kelly, we can fly
But toucan fly together
Staying staying rich like an ostrich

Free up my love
Free up my love
Free up my love
Free up my love
Staying staying rich like an ostrich

Now watch the sky, watch the sky
Keep watching
Wa-watch the sky, watch the sky
Keep watching
Wa-wa-watch the sky, watch the sky
Keep watching
Wa-watch the sky, watch the sky
Wa-watch

Is that a crow on a crane?
Is that you or a plane?
Where's your chicken at?
I'm watching like a hawk
I need more birds!
Gully like a seagull
Gully like a seagull
I'm coo coo for you, let's talk

Free up my love
Free up my love
Free up my love
Free up my love
Staying staying rich like an ostrich
