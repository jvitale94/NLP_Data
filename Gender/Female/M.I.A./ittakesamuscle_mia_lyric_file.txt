

Now the fear got in me 
It's got in me deep 
It's where it's gonna stay and never leave. 
Someone come lay my worry 
Someone come kill my pain. 
Someone come and put me on my feet again. 

It takes a muscle to fall in love 
It takes a muscle to fall in love 
It takes a muscle to fall in love 
It takes a muscle to fall in love 

We gotta love one another 
That's what the good man says 
But i got too much trouble 
Going on in my head 
Someone come and pick up my love 
Take it all away 
Cause I could break down tomorrow 
If I don't die today 

It takes a muscle to fall in love 
It takes a muscle to fall in love 
It takes a muscle to fall in love 
It takes a muscle to fall in love 
Ay
