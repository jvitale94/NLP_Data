Work work work work

Hey, are you ok?
Tell em you're not ok
Tell em you're taking off work today

Are you ok?
Ali are you ok?
Tell em you're not gonna be working late

It's been ages
Since you spent a day just
Don't ignore your doctor's orders
Now come here
Show me how you're loving me

All work and no play
I think we need a holiday
All work and no play
Tell em it's your birthday

All your best days are given to your boss way
Tell em you're working on us today
Do you wanna be running after money
Or be home hanging with your honey
Now come here, show me how you're loving me

All work and no play
I think we need a holiday
All work and no play
Tell em it's your birthday

Ali I haven't even seen you since we left Calais
You've been so busy
It's driving me crazy

You know I gotta be grinding
Sorry if I'm flaking
All this money that I be taking
I'm just shaking what I'm making
I'm sending bread and bacon
Back home so they can
Fix what's broken
So baby don't be hating
If you need vacation
Please be patient
I'm thinking generation
Coz it's my obligation

All work and no play
I think we need a holiday
