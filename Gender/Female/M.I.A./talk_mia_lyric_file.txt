What you stand for that's relevant
Tweet tweet read read watch again
Me me me is what you vent
Nothing really changed since you been top ten
All in the streets are hungry, man
You don't give us what we need then
We gonna get hot and hit the bend
This you send
Click again
Kick me down and I'm back again
Gonna fight pen with my pen
I fire that round till you stop the trend

I talk and talk until I piss em off
I talk and talk until I piss em off
I talk and talk until I piss em off
I talk talk talk talk


This system has to come
With way better shit than racism
Hatism or Hate Islam
Better check up on the baptism
If you don't give a fuck that's skepticism
If you do give a shit that's whack to some
If you got a brain let's practice em
Is it tic for tac
Getting back at em
Here we come here we come
Dance on the street like I hit a drum
Here we come here we come
Dance on the street like I hit a drum

I talk and talk until I piss em off
I talk and talk until I piss em off
I talk and talk until I piss em off
I talk talk talk talk


Year to year I say yeah yeah
In warrior mode there nothing to fear
Ebola scare or a bomb scare
It's the same shit just hit and share

I talk and talk until I piss em off
I talk and talk until I piss em off
I talk and talk until I piss em off
I talk talk talk talk
