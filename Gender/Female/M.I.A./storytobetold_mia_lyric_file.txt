Wrote a letter to the pope
He never gave me rope
In the times I couldn't cope
He never gave me rope
In the times I couldn't cope
They cleaned up the dope and censored my scope
The writing on the walls been beaten to a pulp
The writing on the walls been beaten to a pulp
All I ever wanted was my story to be told
All I ever wanted was my story to be told

I never got struck by somethin' in my core
I never took back that joint I rolled
What happens now to the truth I told
Do they all roll over and die in the cold
All I ever wanted was my story to be told
All I ever wanted was my story to be told

A skate board rolled, a lighting bolt
Droppin' on 'em but it ain't their fault
Droppin' on 'em but it ain't their fault
Maybe I am floored but it needs to be told
All I ever wanted was my story to be told
All I all I ever wanted was my story to be told
