You tuck me and I'll tuck you back, you kiss me and I'll kiss you back

The... hate me like a monday, tuesday's my d day know that
Get away on a mother way friday
Hip-hop away with your swag is a no way crazy
I say cha cha cha cha, or ola ola ola ola
Double dare me, double dare you back, I dare you every time we're that
Cha cha cha cha, or ola ola ola ola
Double dare me, double dare you back, I dare you every time we're that

Kiss and I'll kiss you back, I got to keep on going
You zig me and I'll zag you back, I got to keep on going
You tuck me and I'll tuck you back, I got to keep on going
You kiss me and I'll kiss you back, I got to keep on going
Oh oh oh oho, oh oh oh oho, I bite back
Oh oh oh oho, oh oh oh oho, I bite back

And check me in for my resume, thanks... my mom and dad
Hot spicy like the... over there toilet that way
Run away if you can't stop me
Cha cha cha cha, or ola ola ola ola
Double dare me, double dare you back, I dare you every time we're that

Kiss and I'll kiss you back, I got to keep on going
You zig me and I'll zag you back, I got to keep on going
You tuck me and I'll tuck you back, I got to keep on going
You kiss me and I'll kiss you back, I got to keep on going
Kiss and I'll kiss you back, I got to keep on going
You zig me and I'll zag you back, I got to keep on going
You tuck me and I'll tuck you back, I got to keep on going
You kiss me and I'll kiss you back, I got to keep on going

You see the... the go and coming,
You see the... the go and coming,
You see the... the go and coming,
You see the... the go and coming, all night long
Let me say all night long, let me say all night long
You see the... the go and coming,
You see the... the go and coming,
You see the... the go and coming,
You see the... the go and coming, all night long
Let me say all night long, let me say all night long
