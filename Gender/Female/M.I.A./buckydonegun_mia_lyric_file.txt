Quiet down I need to make a sound 
New York 
Quiet down I need to make a sound 
Kingston 
Quiet down I need to make a sound 
Brazil 
Quiet down I need to make sound 

They're coming through the window 
They're coming through the door 
They're busting down the big wall 
And Sounding the horn 

What you Want 
Bucky Done Gun 
What you want 
The Fire Done Burn 
What you want 
Bucky Done Gun 
Get Crackin' Get Get Crackin' 

Time to spit new shit 
I'm rocking on this new bit 
I'm hot now you'll see 
I'll fight you just to get peace 

Heavy Weight Wrestler 
Fight me in your comforter 
Let you be superior 
I'm flithy with the fury ya 

London 
Quiet down I need to make a sound 
New York 
Quiet down I need to make a sound 
Kingston 
Quiet down I need to make a sound 
Brazil 
Quiet I need to make sound 

I'll hard drive your bit 
I'm battered by your sumo grip 
Lucky I like feeling shit 
My Stamina can take it 
Gymnastics Super Fit 
Muscle in the gun clip 
Bite, Teeth Nose Bleed 
Tied up in a scarf piece 

What you Want 
Bucky Done Gun

Get Crackin' Get Get Crackin' 

Can I get control 
Do you like me vulnerable 
I'm armed and I'm equal 
More fun for the people 
Physical, Brute force 
Steel, lion you're the boss 
Yeah, you're so do-able 
Grind me down sugar slow 

What you Want 
Bucky Done Gun 
What you want 
The Fire Done Burn 
What you want 
Bucky Done Gun 
Get Crackin' Get Get Crackin'
