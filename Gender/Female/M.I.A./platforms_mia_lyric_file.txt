Dirty road makes that scarf wrap a must
Rolling by scrolling for the future on the app
Data mine my mind like a diamond in the rough

A platform, here's a train of thought
Getting to the bright side of me is why I fought
I'm gonna say what else have I got
Maybe there's glory in all the things I'm not

Guns keep it fun, keeping men keeping on the run 

If oil is the god then the cranes all pray
The crude is so rude cause it makes the people pay
On the side of the road men make money
A flower for a dollar man, he wants a family

If I rose to power, it'd be a bouquet
Emoji a smiley and say I'm okay
The tech dudes are the only ones having a good day
Coz talking is cheap cause they make it easy

A platform, here's a train of thought
Getting to the bright side of me is why I fought
I'm gonna say what else have I got
Maybe there's glory in all the things I'm not

Guns keep it fun, keeping men on the run
Those who love heat, yeah, here comes the sun
Power to the people, yeah, the light is never done
Switch on for the bitches, yeah electric city fun

A platform, here's a train of thought
Getting to the bright side of me is why I fought
I'm gonna say what else have I got
Maybe there's glory in all the things I'm not

Guns keep it fun, keeping men keeping on the run
