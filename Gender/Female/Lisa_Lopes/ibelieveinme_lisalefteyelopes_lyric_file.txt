

This jam is dedicated to moi
That's right you guys it's just for...

Me, I believe in me
'Cause I take care of me
It took so long to see
All I really need is me
Faith and family
Has finally made me see
No matter what I face
All I need is me

Everybody says they know me better than I know myself
But I don't know nobody else has felt what I felt
Did what I did or been where I been
But have to defend myself again and again
Let it end where it begins
Who cares what the cause is
Too many bosses cause divorces
And I don't take losses
Well I play with a team
But I'm a Diana Ross and not a Supreme
You think you got me all figured out
Ohh so I'm so shallow 
The only thing I'm tryin' to get is a bigger house
No part of my need is a company
Where I can hire my own people
To live out their dreams
So tell me
What's happenin' to all of ya'll people with low self-esteem
What you want me to cry on your shoulder
So you can turn around and laugh and talk about it when it's over

Me, I believe in me
'Cause I take care of me
It took so long to see
All I really need is me
Faith and family
Has finally made me see
No matter what I face
All I need is me

I done sold 30 mill, dated, then made you want it
When it got too convenient, I just gave it up
I don't need the stress
I don't need the pain
I do need the checks
But don't need the games
Ohh my how could him and I be the same
When the house burnt down
Only I made the blame
When the money got funny, I took it to court
When most of y'all scrubs
Wouldn't have even fought it
When the group had issues, I laid in thought
Corrected the bad news, I heard in interviews
How many of you really know Lisa? Not many!
It's not contrary, it's fear, I don't know you either
I'm responsible for more than you'll ever know or see
So many things you don't know happened because of me
From Blaque, to the designs of the stage, that was me
So how could any of ya'll be mad at me?

Me, I believe in me
'Cause I take care of me
It took so long to see
All I really need is me
Faith and family
Has finally made me see
No matter what I face
All I need is me

Everybody says all they want is the truth
Well the truth is I still got love for my group
But you don't really want the truth when it's concernin' you
You want to hear that no one's doin' better than you
You love to hear the pain
You love to hear the struggle
You love to know that paradise
Has got trouble
The only trouble we ever had
Is you bein' involved
You gettin' involved where you don't belong
When my faith started to waver it was like I was done
I felt like Brian McKnight I was "Back At One"
The only one that was
The only one that ever
The only one I need
The one and only me
Because if I hadn't told you it was on different planes
You would think that I meant our flights ain't the same
My only crime was I was so blind
Didn't know I had everything I wanted all the time

Me, I believe in me
'Cause I take care of me
It took so long to see
All I really need is me
Faith and family
Has finally made me see
No matter what I face
All I need is me

Me, I believe in me
'Cause I take care of me
It took so long to see
All I really need is me
Faith and family
Has finally made me see
No matter what I face
All I need is me

Me, I believe in me
'Cause I take care of me
It took so long to see
All I really need is me
Faith and family
Has finally made me see
No matter what I face
All I need is me
