

You said, you said we could dance forever
You said, two hearts in the wild could bloom together
I remember, I remember

Being with the flowers, baby
Running round in spring with you
Dancing on your pedestal
Praying to your crescent moon
I remember, I remember, I remember
We were gods before this (gods)

We were made from the heat of the stars
I reached for a love, tucked too deep in your heart
I held u up to where birds never fly
You held me tight in the frame of your mind
I would suffer the nature of rain for you baby
This is nothing to hide
I was just born with nothing that was mine
You was raised up with no one on your side

All I am is fossiled youth
In waves of want for you
Baby, if my memories didn't make me bleed
I would leave the wild for you


All our heartache we consume (I know you do, I know you do)
In our young years, oh we're doomed, yeah (You know we do, you know we do)
But I'm in a different love, I think I'd die for you, yeah, yeah
Open up the sky, make it cry for you, yeah, yeah (I know you do)
All this feels like eros in the spring, don't it? yeah, yeah
I remember all the pretty things, won't I (I remember)

Being in the forest, baby
Covered by the jumper's nooses
Praying that the trees weren't dead
Finding you with all those bruises
I remember I tried to revive you, remember
But you were gone for good (gone)

You were dancing with demons and smothered in youth
Couldn't be more undeserving of you
Couldn't be more unprepared for the truth, oh yeah
I was battling secrets, obsessed with the dead
Painted the blue that was left of me red
Burying skulls in the back of my head, oh yeah, yeah yeah

If all our love's now memories
Then was it meant to be
Baby, if it leaves our hearts so instantly
Then was it make believe, yeah

Oh, I hurt all over, it's the worst baby (You know I do)
Thinking 'bout the magic in your skirt, baby (You know we do)
Sorry, you bruised your knees, yeah
Running wild in the trees, yeah
Will you remember me, yeah


All our heartache we consume (I know you do, I know you do)
In our young years, oh we're doomed, yeah (You know we do, you know we do)
But I'm in a different love, I think I'd die for you, yeah, yeah
Open up the sky, make it cry for you, yeah, yeah (I know you do)
All this feels like eros in the spring, don't it? yeah, yeah
I remember all the pretty things, won't I (I remember)

Being in the desert, baby, talking 'bout your energy
Trying to teach aura shields to save you from you enemies
Remember, don't you remember
Don't you, don't you, don't you
Don't you
Oh oh-oh oh
