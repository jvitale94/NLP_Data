Love wasted no potion
Poor baby don't make a sound
Everybody wanna break you down
I'm broken can't hide it
Where the truth at can't find it
They tell me all these lies
No truth in all these lies
Momma says don't give your world to no man
But truth beef love till you got that ring on your hand
Nobody knows nobody knows that
Everybody feels what don't nobody show so


Live it up, live it up
Take them all down
Live it up, live it up
Take it all now
Live it up, live it up
Take them all down
Break a couple hearts
Leave a couple round
Live it up, live it up
Take them all down
Live it up, live it up
Take it all now
Break a couple hearts
Break a couple hearts but don't fall in love no...


Still broken fast forward
Feel the pain now ignore it
I'm running but what towards
I don't know but I'm going
Can't feel shit that's boring
That's real shit and you know it
I then felt more than a little bit
But I rather be a heart breaker than a little bitch
Momma says don't give your world to no man
But truth beef love till you got that ring on your hand
Nobody knows nobody knows that
Everybody feels what don't nobody show so


Live it up, live it up
Take them all down
Live it up, live it up
Take it all now
Live it up, live it up
Take them all down
Break a couple hearts
Leave a couple round
Live it up, live it up
Take them all down
Live it up, live it up
Take it all now
Break a couple hearts
Break a couple hearts but don't fall in love no...


I live by the words of a wise man
He said don't go falling in love so as much as I can
I steer clear of all of that stuff I fear that
I am a little less emotional
Took a couple fucking pills I think that I overdosed
Gotta dark side shit you can call it comatose
Everybody quick to talk about some shit that they don't know
Fuck what you heard, like I'm fucking what you heard
Like the word's to my clit, and I'm fucking every word
Fucking every verb do something for me now
I play dirty like shoes under money ground
I'm too smart where the dudes try to dumb me down
But they get played like blues in the fucking south
I get you open and choose when to shut you out
Walk up in it like guess who's in the fucking house
Damn I own it I own it condone it
Heart breaker heart taker content with my wrong and
I'm scared that I may never make it back
They say they love me I don't know what to say to that
I mean I'm trying I just don't know what to make of that
I got good intentions I just forgot where I placed them at


Live it up, live it up
Take them all down
Live it up, live it up
Take it all now
Live it up, live it up
Take them all down
Break a couple hearts
Leave a couple round
Live it up, live it up
Take them all down
Live it up, live it up
Take it all now
Break a couple hearts
Break a couple hearts but don't fall in love no...

Live it up, live it up
Take them all down
Live it up, live it up
Take it all now
Live it up, live it up
Take them all down
Break a couple hearts
Leave a couple round
Live it up, live it up
Take them all down
Live it up, live it up
Take it all now
Break a couple hearts
Break a couple hearts but don't fall in love no...


Love is a choice
And the chance that I can take
Is everything I ever loved
Is one big mistake
I never hurt again
Never feel a brush
Until the next
I'm on the move, ah
