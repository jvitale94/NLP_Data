(The Mothership Connection)

There's no way you can skip the subject
You move your hips to this cause you love it
Admire it
And I'm the one who inspired it
It's the YoYo
This isn't a promo
Come on down, so you can play _The Price is Right_
I get twice as nice, I'ma get nice tonight
Get with this, dig the style and the lecture
Feel the texture and you can see how it affects the
applies the plans and pan it left to right
And then a close up
I get the most of
A style, so focus on the one who broke the barrier
I'm preparin ya
Illustratin many ways of tearin the
Mic, rippin it, put a clip in it
Load the ammo, let it slam when I be kickin it
Stick it in your Jeep or your Benzo
It's in so
Deep you can bet
YoYo never break a sweat
Quiet is kept
But you thought that you had enough
Problems, withstand me
You must go to plan b
Shake away and break away and take away
A brother who fold
So make way for the Motherlode

Here's a piece or a chunk of the funkiness
You can't understand how a sister came up with this
Style
That's so wild
It leaves you shiverin and danglin
From the way that I be stranglin
MC's and take their breath away literally
Many step up but they can't get a bit of me
MC's dash light like this is their last night
On Earth, but they get turned out like a flash light
Don't consume this, it's toxic and poisonous
There's no need to bring all your girls to this
Cause I'll dis you and fry you on a skillet like a piece of pork
I don't care if you're from East New York
I don't flinch or move an inch cause this bitch
Is from LA, so make way for the monkey wrench
And fit it your program
I'm swoopin in the Mothership as if it was a Brougham
It's funk that's pumped to the top of the dome
And you can bet your last dollar on the fact that it's on
So admit you was taken by the storm
Of the form of the Motherlode

You had to make way
So sit down and take a
Number
You was asleep and so you slumber
Silently
You can't match me or tie with me
There's a fungus among us
So don't try to tongue this
Phrase or speak it, try to freak it
It's unique cause I've got the secret
You're peekin eye for eye as I plan this
Open wide as I try to cram this
Microphone down your throat with forcefulness
You can't afford this, so write a report of this
Tell the world how I dissed and dismissed ya
And brought you turbulence, sort of like a twister
Sisters smother me and cover me and shower me with praises
For the way that I played ya
YoYo's a mother when it comes to the discovery of dopeness
So don't deliver any close
Any similar, any mine, any form, any shape, any tape
With the Street Knowledge label is a caper
Thought about a mother and a brother who's belligerent
Focus on a female, watch as I deliver it
Del the Homo Sapien and Jinx got the back of the Motherlode
Step to the front, so I could shove the load
Of shit you delivered up the ass where it came from
Straight to the rectum
That's what you expected of
The Motherlode
