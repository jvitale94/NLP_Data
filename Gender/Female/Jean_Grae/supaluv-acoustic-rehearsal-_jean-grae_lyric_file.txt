(Verse 1)
I was a skeptic, hesitant, even when he said
I've heard that line before
It always carried some ill intent for sure
But then he said it some more
Pretend I've never been in love, I'm not getting sprung
But I could miss it, he could be the one
Go one better and he could make me believe that
About Jean, I'm 'bout to
Call my family, be like "I met him mom! Wedding's on!"
Ready to party but instead I'm calm
Surface though, all fireworks, wired up espresso
His expressiveness is impressive but let's go
Chill in the tropics drinking rum punch, One Love
Singing it over lunch he got me love done style
My luck's been out, feel me?
It done run south, left me a ton of doubt
It's never fun getting the run-around (uh-uh)
Wooed easy, I bruise easy
When dudes leave me I get boozed ugly, they don't trust me
He freaking speech though and I'm drinking ghost lager
A teensy-more-than-moderate feeling you both scatter
Feeling your clothes cos you're appealing and you're really close
Thinking of stashing you up in my pocket, being ghost
Check it, I'm long-legged
We could wreck my dorm mattress
You could be my new partner, uh baby, my new fetish

(Hook)
Could this be the Supa Luv for me?
I'm looking for the one in all my dreams
In all my dreams
Could you be my supa love
I need a supa love
I need a supa love

(Verse 2)
This one's different now
Step to me dancing, hand in my back pants
And dancing to back tinting
Same line, way fine, he from the Cayman Islands
And my waistline he trace, fine enough flutter my eyelids I'm
Drinking Patron shots, so much the floor shake
Loving every bit of him he's sputtering the rhythm and
Buttering Grae's ego with the clean-cut pimp-lean
With the clean glean,, "I tink I love he!"
Picture us lovely playing games he's hugging me
Staying engaged two weeks, eloping out the country
Not a spark of potential and um
Y'all, did I mention he's a tall drink of water?
Sink him into me mentally, intensely feeling him
Intentionally sipping Hennessy, let's leave the building
So we can build more, he's so hot
We can have a family because he told me he got

(Hook)
Supa Luv for Jean
Could you be the supa love for me
I'm looking for the one in all my dreams
Could you be my supa love
I need a supa love
I need a supa love
And also some god damn water

(Hook)
Supa Luv for Jean
Could you be the supa love for me
I'm looking for the one in all my dreams
Could you be my supa love
I need a supa love
I need a supa love
