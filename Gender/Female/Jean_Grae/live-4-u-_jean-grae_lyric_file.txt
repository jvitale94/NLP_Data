It's kind of hard to explain, but I've been thinking, haven't come to a decision
drinking away the pain night after night, listen
it's like I'm caught in the rain that never stops and only follows me 
wide hollow feeling of emptiness, nothing inside of me
drama lays my head on the pillow, but still no sleep
been walking this wonderland for forty days and seven weeks
just wondering how good it would be
to finally say goodbye to everything that's going wrong, God, especially me
I wanna let go, let my mind just finally be free
breath with no echo, tomorrow won't be less without me
? stayin wet though, only thing that keeps me on the side of the living is you
said the same thing to me too
otherwise, I'm just caught up in deception and lies
I have days of just waking and hating the sunshine
hating life itself, hating death for taking it's time
loving you enough not to commit the ultimate crime
I sin in my mind though, visions of weaponry's wetting me up
paying people off for setting me up,
some crazy wild sick imagery, painting pictures of bloody scenes 
seems the only peace of mind is in dreams
so I pray for never ending sleep but it never comes
so I pray for being so weak, and giving up
friends say I live the party life, living it up
one hand on the glass, other on the bottle, filling it up
I wanna leave so bad but loving you is enough
to make a slow exit to hell, would never leave you here by yourself
no body else could keep me here but you
no body could else could wipe away the tears but you
I love you too much

I would give my life for you, if you asked me to
I would do, just anything for you
and the world if I could, I would give to you
but I don't have anything to give
so I swear just to live for you, live for you 

Are you disappointed in me?
twenty-three, can't get it together
no money no job and debt that seems to last forever 
I just wanna make you proud one day 
like accepting awards in front of a crowd
and say thanks in front of a million people
tell you I've fallen victim to some evil things in the past
my roads been short but rough
a lot of things you don't know, even if you asked
I wanna tell you all but I can't
you're too precious for that
trying to explain why your daughters into rap
I'm like guilt with a guilty conscience 
emotional politics ? me
constantly pregnant with a rowdy problem children in me
I wonder if we switched places, changed the dial on me
would you rather be somebody else's mommy?
divorced probably, ???????????
I understand the reason, it's the quality of living
and what you want for children
I'm not giving it, but you're the kind of love that never gives up

I would give my life for you, if you asked me to
I would do, just anything for you
and the world if I could, I would give to you
but I don't have anything to give
so I swear just to live for you, live for you 

I promised I'm going to buy you that house on the beach
a whole damn street
give you grandchildren, two maybe three
build you a studio and get you back to recording
and singing whenever you want, give you whatever you want
I know you miss the music too, you just put up a front
but I can see it in your eyes, musical echo soul cries to be free
don't you worry about me, I'm going to be alright
when I'm in darkness you're my light
I just think different, like you taught me
the way you do, shine different, they all can see
I just wanna tell you you're loved
and anything that I could ever do for you is never enough

I would give my life for you, if you asked me to
I would do, just anything for you
and the world if I could, I would give to you
but I don't have anything to give
so I swear just to live for you, live for you
