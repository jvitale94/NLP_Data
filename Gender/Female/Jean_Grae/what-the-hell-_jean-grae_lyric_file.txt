(Hook)
What the hell are y'all looking for
Can't a black woman make money anymore
What the hell are y'all looking for
Can't a black girl write rhymes anymore
What the hell are y'all looking for
Can't a black woman get money anymore
Nah really
What the fuck are you looking at , stop it

(Verse)
Logically I could be ahead of the game
Pass skip flame rhymes, pass to fame times so I claim mine
Contain minus ready to bust deadly cut through
Like a T, T-Rex motherfucker none of you want it
I'm pumping your stomach , I'm hungry I needed tuition
I preaching so close that I can finally taste it
It's foul like bowl an hour one mile
With the final destination God bless me, the child
And all the time accumulate the power to make me
I'm still faceless but they all see
Number 3 on the wait list slow is weightless
And our show is greater than impeccable sense of hatred
Smile sinister rhyme regular never get it
I administer punishment like a bad lieutenant
I flow jo with a bad name I'm goin' slow
Except when guns blow I join the courtesy
I know y'all enjoy the curse at first
Listen to chain your position by the start of verse 3
Given , school to rehearse but remove your distaste
Before I pull your waist up see other way from face first
Praise so God stop answering but you may not get off your knees
Till He himself puts a hand on 'em
I'm panning anthems this year get up and stand for them
Up your grands and pennies I got plans for them
Do a hand stand I'm your band stand writing your show man
He could speak a less stage in the front row
I run slow even the gum smoke my lung opened up
Shit to make a fine man that he gonna choke
Done woke ye , I shine like december don't set me
So bright still not in my prom ye
Cut off your privates get blood on your eyelids
Red splash so hard then it rains on you violent
Try and test you get divided but try us I'm restless
I got you on a death wish check list
Like uhh may turn it up wounds and hurt them
In search of crew here jerk red dot murder them
I can't stop serving 'em I am not certain
That your rear clear view it's a ship ye I'm learning them
Get your bars up like cali done said
I got mine just over your head now

(Hook)
What the hell are y'all looking for
Can't a black woman make money anymore
What the fuck are y'all looking for
Can't a black girl write rhymes anymore
What the fuck are y'all looking for
Can't a black woman make money anymore nigga
Nah seriously
Don't fucking look at me, I'll fucking smack you
