Due to circumstances beyond anyone's control
The party is over at twelve o'clock
So whatever has to be done, has to be done right about now
And I say, Spinderella, are you with me?
Salt and Pepa, are you with me?

I am down
To take it or to break it on the mic all night
'Cuz I'm Salt everybody, yeah, Salt
I'm the Pepa everybody, the Pepa

Come see the three
Young ladies in the fellas' fantasies
'Cuz we will be trend setters to all MC's

Yeah, that's right, Money, this one's for you
Special dedication to the NYC crew
We didn't change much as you can see
And the beats are still hyped up by Hurby

In the house, crowds are packin'
They're all glad to see us back in step
Now flip if you oppose it, don't sweat it
I'm talkin' to those that's with it

This beat is strong not feable
Worse than Bad Lone Joe, it's evil
Deeper still when the jam is filled up
You can feel the tension build up

Waiting for show time
So we can just throw rhymes
Back, forth and around to show

I'm down
To take it or to break it on the mic all night
'Cuz I'm Salt everybody, yeah, Salt
That's Salt everybody, yeah, Salt

I'm the source, of course
Like salad fresh rhymes I'm a toss
Of me and we and on the M I C
I'm the queen

Of this I am but I'm not just sayin' it
I'm takin' my time and layin' it down on tracks
'Cuz my beat smacks, sticks to your ears like wax
These rhymes are mine not rented

When I say I'm down, I meant it
According to a scientific breakthrough
My rhymes are designed to make you
React with passion to coming attractions

You paid to bathe in non stop action
Temperature rise, blood starts to boil
I keep you fresh like aluminum foil

So you won't spoil, melt or harden, see
Tell 'em, Salt, tell 'em excuse me
Hey, I just wanted to say

I am down
To take it or to break it on the mic all night
I'm the Pepa everybody, the Pepa
She's the Pepa everybody, the Pepa

Party people if you can throw your hand
In the air and wave it like a fan
And I rock till you drop
'Cuz Pepa everybody is hot

Now here's my credential, here's my background
To prove I'm the one to make you get down to this
Not a wish but a fact I'm stating
The heat is on, there'll be no shading

I know I'm down not out
And if you are too, then shout
Stop, okay, now go and listen to the pros
'Cuz we know how to be down and show

The best around what this comes down to
I'm sure that you are bound to
Share my thoughts on how to be down also
Not a clown around town

So I crack a little smile
And my gold fronts glow
Keep my coat open
So my dope robe shows

I'm down
To take it or to break it on the mic all night
Check it out everybody, check it out
Check it out everybody, check it out

Salt and Pepa everybody's in the house
Salt and Pepa everybody's in the house
Check it out everybody, check it out
Salt and Pepa everybody's in the house
