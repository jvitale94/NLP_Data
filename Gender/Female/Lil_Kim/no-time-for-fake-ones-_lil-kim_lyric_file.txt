Aah, I momma, Miss Navana
Usually rock the prada, sometimes cabbana
Stick you for your cream and your riches
Jaja Kabal, Demi Moore, Chris Diana, all them rich misses

Puff Daddy bump the Hummer for the summer
I follow in the e-class with the goggles
96 Models, bad blick on the stroll
Tell 'em how we roll

Cruise control, nothing make a woman feel better
Then barrettas and ammerettes
But in mad chedders and leathers
Chillin' in a Benz with my amigos
Tryin' to stick a brother for a peso

If you say so, then I'm the same chick
You wanna get with and lick me where it's hot
Gotta hit the spot, if not then don't test
A poom-nanny-nanny, punany donny, hey

How you like it, baby?
Uhh, from the front, uhh, from the back
Give that ass a smack
Bet your man won't do it like that

Can't work the middle plus his thing too little
Work down your ta-ta's, do the cha-cha
Make you scream papa
You da best, da da, now watch mama

Go up and down with the jaws crazy, unh
Oh, say my name baby and you know, ain't no one
Like the queen bee, have you speaking in French
Ooh-la, oui, oui, c'est la vie

Then I cracks for the Mercedes
I act shady and feel my 360 gator boots for ladies
Ooh, oui, I see act shadey
And feel my creaty, autoraven

Ooh, wee I see, your girl ain't a freak
Like me or Adina, huh, can't fade a rhinoceros in rap
Lil' Kim a rookie, how preposterous is that?

Right back at the one Cleopatra, diggin' in your stash
Players think they gonna get some ass
No money-money, no licky-licky
Forget the sticky sticky and your quickie

Give me your loot, you Mack-11 then shoot
Your game ain't sweet, Jean Paul pete shouldn't compete
If you can't wet it, forget it, don't sweat it
I bet it make it come smooth if you let it

Huh, you can't stop a chick from ballin'
Ha-ha to la-la to drop-by's they be calling
And you ain't know while you be kickin that old shit

We making hits platinum and gold shit
We stay draped in diamonds and pearls
Beside every man there's a bad girl, that's right
