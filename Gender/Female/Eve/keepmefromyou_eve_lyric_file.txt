There ain't enough money in the world
Boy together I get high, smooches, our lips lock
Together I get high, get high


So you want a black Porsche, knew I was in love
Come on up a brown skin, yea give it up
Fell so hard, won't you come and pick me up?
Had a taste once and I can't get enough
Mesmerized by the green in yo eyes
Takin it back by the swag in yo stry
I done got picked up by the love boat
Eat it up, go hard with yo love girl


I don't care what they say, I'm in love
There ain't enough money in the world
Boy together I get high, smooches, our lips lock
Together I get high, get high
Nothing can keep me from you
Nothing can keep me from you
Keep me from you, keep me from you


You know that thief in the night
Stole my heart so you better treat it right
I ain't even wanna listen what my friends say
'Cause I know that it's all just jealousy
Is it punched or glow
Or could it just be infatuation?
Uh, whatever that is
Time will tell, I don't care, let's live
For the nightless world, alien love, wanna be your girl
Milk chaser, stumbling,
When I get next to you I'm mumbling
If a chick try to step up we rumbling
Want a future with you like remember boy


I don't care what they say, I'm in love
There ain't enough money in the world
Boy together I get high, smooches, our lips lock
Together I get high, get high
Nothing can keep me from you
Nothing can keep me from you
Keep me from you, keep me from you


You're so much more than a crush
I'm down like the Chevy on dubs
On lock, by the pioneer cuffs
Your house is my home, let me get my stuff
I'm sick, don't need no medicine
Cupid shot me in the heart, veteran
I'm gone, ain't no point of back your cold flow
Let's make it last


I don't care what they say, I'm in love
There ain't enough money in the world
Boy together I get high, smooches, our lips lock
Together I get high, get high
Nothing can keep me from you
Nothing can keep me from you
Keep me from you, keep me from you

Nothing can keep me from you

I don't care what they say, I'm in love
There ain't enough money in the world
Boy together I get high, smooches, our lips lock
Together I get high, get high
Nothing can keep me from you
