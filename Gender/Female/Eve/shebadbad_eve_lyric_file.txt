Yeah that's right I'm badder than them
E-V-E the cataclysm
Blow 'em out the fuckin' water
Kill 'em dead, call escorta
Ain't my fault I had it built up
Had to get it out my system
Now I'm back, forget about them
other chicks man you won't miss 'em.
Yeah, E-V-E hungry like a lion
I ain't never easy, never scared, why you tryin'?
Your gimmick make me sicky,
What you selling, I ain't buying
Man I live up at the top so you keep climbing.
No they can never catch her
Me I'm the chick that keep 'em under pressure
And every nigga smell her wanna sex her
They say they wanna protect her
But really they just wanna kiss and caress her
Now sit your ass down, 'cause class is now in session.

Oh she bad bad, Oh she bad bad
Oh she bad bad, Oh she bad bad
Oh she bad bad, Oh she bad bad

When they see me coming at 'em
Hills and hips, they wanna grab 'em
Lips and eyes staring at 'em
Mesmerized, gotta have it.
Wanted, I'll become a habit
Needed, always once you had it
Ever lucky enough to grab it
Guaranteed becoming an addict.
Yeah, the type of chick that like them big trips
Big jets, mega yachts, yeah big ships
Wanna get all my affection, here's a big tip
I need to see that you a boss, shit.
Man, I ain't playing with you people
You know my style already, Scorpion, she stinks, she lethal
I ain't even got no patience for your bullshit, I can see through
I get bored real easy, Sorry I must leave you
Got 'em singing like


Oh she bad bad, Oh she bad bad
Oh she bad bad, Oh she bad bad
Oh she bad bad, Oh she bad bad
Oh she bad bad, Oh she bad bad
Oh she bad bad, Oh she bad bad
Oh she bad bad, Oh she bad bad

You know my style already, you know my style already
You know my style already
