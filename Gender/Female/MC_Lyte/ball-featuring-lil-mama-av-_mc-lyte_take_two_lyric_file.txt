[Verse 1 - Lil Mama:]
They wanna get close-up, get personal
Why ya gotta be the first to know?
I hit em highs, miss the lows
Neva seen the chicks so versatile
I been everywhere you've been and back
Still intact, building stacks
Body bagging, killing tracks
You probably heard me stuntin'
Award shows, no frontin'
I'm jet-settin' to london
What ya heard I done done it
Like, woah, everyday
I'm just hustlin', gettin' paper
Who is you? ain't a custom
Gettin' cake, baby, that's what I do

[Hook:]
I'm only followin' mine, and that money I trust
Neva beat around the bush, let's get straight to the point
I don't do all that talkin', I might value few buckin'
But besides all that, let's all get to the money
Ball, tame my soul, I come to the ends still sayn
Let's all get to the money!
Ball, do my thing, no ching, boy, you luv to hear me say
Let's all get to the money and ball

[Verse 2 - MC Lyte:]
And I'm just givin' speeches
Don't give me reasons, I'll turn yo friends into light believers
Haters hate that I shine, tho
But I'm leavin' they mind blown
Betta listen up, betta jack it off
Boy, you ain't new to my rhymes cold
I do this shit with my eyes closed
If money could sing, I hit high notes
Bleedin' through my speakers while I ride home to my condo
Been held rooftop, champagnin' my new spot
Loud fudge, roof's hot with this sick flow to yo flu shot

[Hook:]
I'm only followin' mine, and that money I trust
Neva beat around the bush, let's get straight to the point
I don't do all that talkin', I might value few buckin'
But besides all that, let's all get to the money
Ball, tame my soul, I come to the ends still sayn
Let's all get to the money!
Ball, do my thing, no ching, boy, you luv to hear me say
Let's all get to the money and ball

[Verse 3:]
You ask me and I'm a say it straight
Don't instigate unless you're ready to play
They thrown away and they ready to hate
On my name, my fame, my work to date
I I annihilate, I rise up and I elevate
I'm takin' you from not educated, flip that mix, that integrate
And I'm rate head of state, drip the white house, put a new estate
Thrill blazin', I innovate, gotta get the money, gotta get the cake
Ain't nobody touchin' me, trust me, it will get ugly
Besides all that, let's get back to the money and ball
