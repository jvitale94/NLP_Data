He hah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah come on

I can't make a mistake
Missing the dance floor shake
I gotta get to the floor
I gotta get to the floor

I can't make a mistake
Missing the dance floor shake
I gotta get to the floor
I gotta get to the floor

Romancing in the dark I spark the light
It's alright tonight I gotta get the mic
As I smoke the crowd I spike red eye crippin' them Heineken's
They don't know where they been

Baby got backseat rollin' like Tandy
But you look for good luck, swing in the Expo G
I mean no harm, but that lucky jog
You need to ditch it quick, get with the Brooklyn bomb

I be, we be, pumpin' the spot G
Wherever we be, we hit directly
It's been so long, we gotta get it on
To this song, my song, now sing along come on

I can't make a mistake
Missing the dance floor shake
I gotta get to the floor
I gotta get to the floor

I can't make a mistake
Missing the dance floor shake
I gotta get to the floor
I gotta get to the floor

Come here, let's rap 'n taste a little
Floor's too high, not to jiggle in the middle of tender [unverified]
Cellphone, all chrome, [unverified], come home we double chrome
But I can't make a mistake, hmm

Leave the dance floor now
(Uhn uhn, no no)
I'm on this somethin', he bubble in the sugar baby
Shoulda, woulda, coulda, that ain't need baby

When I step into ya Miss Rock-y [unverified] frame
I change the game
It'll never look the same
Obstructed, abstracted, my tactic, fantastic

It's been so long, we gotta get it on
To this song, my song, now sing along come on
I can't make a mistake
I can't make a mistake

I can't make a mistake
Missing the dance floor shake
I gotta get to the floor
I gotta get to the floor

I can't make a mistake
Missing the dance floor shake
I gotta get to the floor
I gotta get to the floor

Yeah, here he come, lookin' like he 21
Knowing damn well, he too could get done
But he got a partner, and that ain't too hard to fix
Once I slide up in the mix

Suggin' it baby, from right to left
Jigged out, gotta pick ya out from what's left
It's no mystery, the way ya humpin' and bumpin'
No what you comin' home with me?

I'm gon' get some satisfaction
The way you comin' at me with the action
You betta know it, when ya dealing with the poet
Whatever crap you got, you betta show it

It's been so long, we gotta get it on
To this song, my song, now sing along come on
I can't make a mistake
I can't make a mistake

I can't make a mistake
Missing the dance floor shake
I gotta get to the floor
I gotta get to the floor

I can't make a mistake
Missing the dance floor shake
I gotta get to the floor
I gotta get to the floor
