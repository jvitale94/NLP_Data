My Man
Verse1(G.B)- Been with this nigga for 3 fuckin' years. Now, this bitch wanna take my place over here. This bitch don't know who I am. So she better watch out before I give her a body slam. Fed him, caressed him, helped him and fucked him. Now, she wanna take my place as his girlfriend. That ain't happening, so get the fuck outta here. This nigga belongs to me, is that clear?

Chorus- He's MY MAN! What, What, What, Whattt? (repeat3X)

Verse2(Rasheeda)- Bitch, you don't know shit about me. I don't want the nigga, just want his dick inside of me. I'm a freak. Not a 1-man girl. If ya think I'm lyin, ya outta this world. I'm a gangsta bitch, (G.B- No, I am trick!), that's what I mean when I say you don't know shit. Got ya ears closed but ya mouth is wide open. Either yo ass talk to much or you just dick-suckin. I think you got to much mouth. Now, I'ma have to bring out the dirty, dirty south.

Chorus (repeat3X)

Verse3(D.P)- I don't know why bitches fight over a nigga like me. I'm just another gangsta ridin' with my fellow G's. I wanna fuck both of you but I can't take gangsta-bitch fightin' over me from you 2. So ya'll bitches need to figure it out. And if ya'll keep sayin' shit to each other, ya'll will never get this nigga.

Chorus (repeat3X)

Dialogue- G.B- I think I owe an apology to dat girl.
RA- Me Too
G.B- So let's do this.
RA- And do what we gotta do.
Both- Buttt...
