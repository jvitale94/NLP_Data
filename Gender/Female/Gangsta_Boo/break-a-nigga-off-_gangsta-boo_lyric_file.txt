We get it almost every night
When that moon gets big and bright
It's supernatural delight
Everybody was dancing in the moonlight
Everybody here is out of sight
they dont bark and they dont bite
they keep things loose
they keep things light
everybody was dacning in the moonlight
dancing in the moonlight
everybdy feelin warm and bright
its such a fine and natrual sight
everybodys dancin in the moonlight
We like our fun and we never fight
you cant dance and stay up tight
its supernatural delight
everybody was dancing in the moonlight
dancing in the moonlight
everybody feeling warm and bright
its such a fine and natural sight
everybody dancing in the moonlight
deneenenenene
Every body here is out of sight

everybodys dancing in the moonlight
everybodys feelin warm and bright
its such a fine and natural sight
everybodys dancin in the moonlight
everybodys dancin in the moonight
