You play to many games
I ain't even gotta say no names 
Love
Yea like really
Why you gotta make me look so silly
Why you gotta make me feel  so dumb
Cuz I run back to him then he act so dumb
Now chicks in his phone
I'm surprised he ain't dumb
Now yellin letting em scream 
now I'm feelin real dumb
love can be a liar
love can be deceiving
love is never temporary cuz its never leaving
but you left everything that was good for you 
we did all of the things that you wouldn’t do
and now you think I'm  suppose to run back to you
so we can start on over

I thought you was down to ride
But when it came that day 
I guess Somebody lied
See the games you play 
I played  them all the best
And I'm certified 
I'm holdin on to me
Lovin me
A fool for you ill never be
I'm all for you but you don’t see 
I'm lettin go
Get away from me
Neva put a man in front of ya self
Love you first you can do it by yourself
You already know you only bout one thang
But he talkin bout nuttin
He ain't talkin bout a ring 
He ain't talkin bout a ring
Get up outta my face 
He ain't talkin bout a ring 
I can pay my  bills 
He ain't talkin bout a ring
I'm independent
He ain't talkin bout a ring
How you feel

I'm independent
Don’t need for nuttin
I'm always stuntin
I'm what you wantin
Dudes come to me
And I say its nuttin
Cuz I'm into you
You think I'm frontin 
You think I'm frontin
But I'm the same
Imma stay up all nite
When you high shit
Talkin shit
Why you wanna come home all mad
Trynna accuse me of sumthin
Who I'm touchin 
Who I'm lovin
You in my phone ain't findin nuttin
Why you actin like that
I ain't doin nuttin
You me feel ion need lovin 
Ion need you
I wouldn’t give it all up juss to be wit you
And I hate just wateva you cant do
But I know what I gotta do
Love me 
Say bye to you

I thought you was down to ride
But when it came that day 
I guess Somebody lied
See the games you play 
I played  them all the best
And I'm certified 
I'm holdin on to me
Lovin me
A fool for you ill never be
I'm all for you but you don’t see 
I'm lettin go
Get away from me
Neva put a man in front of ya self
Love you first you can do it by yourself
You already know you only bout one thang
But he talkin bout nuthin
He ain't talkin bout a ring 
He ain't talkin bout a ring
Get up outta my face 
He ain't talkin bout a ring 
I can pay my  bills 
He ain't talkin bout a ring
I'm independent
He ain't talkin bout a ring
How you feel

As I take this vow
To love me myself and I
Neva 
Will I put a man before myself
Neva will I settle for less
Neva
Will I be disrespected
See 
Wat I learned is its all temporary
And when you find the right one
You know it
You know it

I thought you was down to ride
But when it came that day 
I guess Somebody lied
See the games you play 
I played  them all the best
And I'm certified 
I'm holdin on to me
Lovin me
A fool for you ill never be
I'm all for you but you don’t see 
I'm lettin go
Get away from me
Neva put a man in front of ya self
Love you first you can do it by yourself
You already know you only bout one thang
But he talkin bout nuthin
He ain't talkin bout a ring 
He ain't talkin bout a ring
Get up outta my face 
He ain't talkin bout a ring 
I can pay my  bills 
He ain't talkin bout a ring
I'm independent
He ain't talkin bout a ring
How you feel
