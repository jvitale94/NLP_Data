Do you really wanna know what hard work is? Ask me and I'll tell you.
From nothing to something. If there is a will there is a way.
Traveling city to city, state to state.
Non stop shows, interviews all over the globe. I am Miami.
Magazine covers, gossips number 1 topic.
The life of the rich and famous.
Fans who can relate, from the begining to now.
Trashy mouth to sophicated ladies.
Not just a rapper, the business woman still standing.
When I've seen others come and go, I rise.
Grateful for my struggles and the road that I took.
It only made me stronger, it prepared me for this.
For the here and now. Focused and eager to learn.
Fast to teach, this is not a game.
This is my life.
Fairy tales dont exist over here.
Im a realist. and strong is just another statement to describe me.
Now I ask you the same question again.

I dont use a bottle, I breast feed the game like theres tommorrow.
I can tell you about pain.......bitches aint shit, niggas aint either.
Niggas want ya chick.
Betta watch the way you treat her.
You shouldn't have to beat her.
Lose her the way you meet her.
