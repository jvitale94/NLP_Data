Put them bottles up, put them bottle up,
All I can say is I enjoy the city lights
Put them bottles up, put them bottles up.

Can I party and have a nice time,
Everything come alive in the  time
Conex for a better life ‘cause I like mine
I laugh although I stay on the top ground.

Everything come alive in the  time
Conex for a better life ‘cause I like mine
I laugh although I stay on the top ground.

I got my mind on my money, money in my hand
I’ve been thinking at dollars 
I stay cash  wondering
What to do if I fall and come again
Playing fast, going hard you can win too
See yourself as a star you begin to
Transform think big and you elevate
Elevating to the top let’s celebrate
Just no
