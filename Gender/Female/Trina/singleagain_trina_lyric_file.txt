checking for me, and never will you find another bitch like me, and I don't care what your
friends say what we had was like Jay and Beyonce.

Hope you find what you looking for
Back on the market
Let's agree to disagree, don't explain shit to me

Six months with you match my cars up
It all started so promising
Got my own diamonds so I gave him back the promise ring



Hold up.

Till get my half, then I sit back, relax
and just laugh (ha ha)
At the times we shared, like flying over B-More, high in the G-4,
smoking on cali bud that's how a real G show a bitch cali love (cali love)
Sex in the cock pit, no love I was just another object (object).
You fell in love with my ass
