Comin soon, it's goin down, baddest chick part 2, reloaded
(badass bitches in the building)


Take me to the bar, give me grey goose
Let me get started, it's time to tag loose
Take me to the bar, give me grey goose
Let me get started, it's time to tag loose
Time to tag loose 


Yea, u want drama well I'm about to start it
With a click for the goons and all of them retarded
Protected custoday is what u gon' need ho
Don't fuck with me, ay, yo, I'm clearin out the dance flo
And I ain't talkin bout a routine
I'm talkin popo's, yellow tag, a murder scence (bitch)
Now don't get slapped with this grey goose bottle
Cause I'm a sharp shooter with intentions that gon' scarr you
It's a good girl gon' bad
Had I woke up on the wrong side of the motherfuckin bed
Shoe's kinda loose, oh shit, of what that last bitch said
Dirty ass bitch, probably wanna get a quick head
Paint her shirt red, letta call her feds
Talkin bout harrassment, fill a bitch with lead
Ay yea I've been gutta, ask my motha (suppose)
Thinkin that I'm sweet cause I was sour on my album cova


Take me to the bar, give me grey goose
Let me get started, it's time to tag loose
Take me to the bar, give me grey goose
Let me get started, it's time to tag loose
Time to tag loose 


I got this grey goose semi, ready for whatever
Any bitch wanna temp me, ain't too clever
The queen should bow down, I ain't heard of that never
Better show me some respect if you know any better
This ain't just a song, it's a kight or a letter
From bitches with wicky thongs
Thinkin they got their shit together
Tryin to block, do voodoo, n pluck my feathers
My team all white plus we rockstarr go-getta's
The feelings mutual, if you can't stand me
That bitch from Miami sometimes I can't stand me
I talk breezy cause it comes easy
Right now feelin myself you swear I'm Jay-Z
I'm MG, feels like I gotta dick, n my balls real big
N I ain't worried bout shit, excuse my french
You can suck this clit, while I'm all out of my zone
Ay bitcha don't say shit


Take me to the bar, give me grey goose
Let me get started, it's time to tag loose
Take me to the bar, give me grey goose
Let me get started, it's time to tag loose
Time to tag loose 


Yea, where's the waitress I need another round
Of the grey shots to the head right now
It's goin down, I can feel it in my bones
I'm a check a bitch from me right about her in the song
She dead wrong cause I don't bother nobody
I just wanna party like la-de-da-de
Or maybe she just wanna be my friend
And now this dumb bitch started somethin
That she can never end (yup)
I'm right here and I ain't goin nowhere
U can tell by myself Trina fans everywhere
You don't care stop lyin on the news
Now gon' change your profession bitch n upgrade the shoe's.
