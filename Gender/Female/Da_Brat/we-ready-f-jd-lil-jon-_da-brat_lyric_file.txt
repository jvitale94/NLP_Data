VERSE 2 
I KEEP THE WINDOWS DOWN 
SO WHEN I HIT THE STOP LIGHT 
ALL THE NIGGAS STANDING AROUND 
SPOT WHAT THEY LIKE 
THEY SHOOT ME THE COME HERE FINGER 
BUT THE MUSIC SO LOUD 
I JUST SMILE AND ACT LIKE I DON'T SEE'EM 
MIGHTA HAD ONE OR TWO MANY SHOTS OF TEQUILA 
BUT WHEN THE SYSTEM CRUNK 
I NEEDS MY LIQUOR 
I'M LOUD AND ROWDY 
NATURALLY PULL UP TO MY TRUCK AND SMILE 
BUT YOU AIN'T PROUD OF ME 
I LEFT YOU IN THE REAR VIEW 
WITH THE LOOK OF DISGUSTS AND A MAD MUG 
CUZ YOUR WINDOWS ALMOST BUST 
I CAN'T FATHOM THE THOUGHT 
OF MY SEATS NOT RUMBLIN' 
AND PEOPLE CATCHIN' WHIPLASH 
WHEN I PASS FRONTIN' 
I'M FLASHY 
AND I DON'T CARE IF YOU KNOW 
I'M FROM THE C. TO THE H.I.G.O. 
I'M FRESH TO DEATH 
NO MATTER HOW I'M DRESSED 
IT'S EVEN HARD FOR THE COPS 
TO PUT ME UNDER ARREST 
IRRESISTIBLY, HUGGABLE AND LOVEABLE WHEN 
I GOTTA WIGGLE MYSELF OUTTA THE TROUBLE I GET IN 
I'M  THE BRAT OFFICER 
HE TURNED AND LAUGHED AND SAID 
STOP DISTURBING THE PEACE AND GOT A AUTOGRAPH 
CUZ. 
HOOK 
VERSE 3 
ROLL UP A FAT ONE AND PASS IT AROUND 
LET SOME NIGGAS HEAR THE SOUNDS 
AND THEY FLAG ME DOWN 
I GET ATTENTION WHEN I'M DRIVING BY 
SHORTY THE PIMP 
REPRESENT THE WEST SIDE OF THE CHI 
KNOW THE HATERS WATCHIN' 
I LOVE MAKIN' EM SICK 
I TEAR THE ROOF OF THIS MOTHER LIKE PARLIMENT 
PEOPLE RIDE WITH ME 
JUST TO FEEL THE BASS IN THEIR CHEST 
AND REMIND HOW IT SOUNDS SO SO DEF 
CUZ
