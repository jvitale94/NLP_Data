So, so Def, hey shortie
How we do? Hey shortie
I'm all about that paper dough
Can you see me? You know, yeah

As the clock keep ticking tick, tick, tick
Gotta keep my vision bleary
I'm in a hurry to get this paper
Don't worry, I'm a dough chaser

I'm still living my dreams whether it's hustling
Shaking and shuffling niggas around, I'm getting more greater
And it's the gang shit that I ain't seen yet
And it's the gang niggas I ain't meet yet

Even though I been to Paris and London
And Rome, Japan, Africa, Baghdad
Amsterdam, brought back a phat sack
And I'm rolling [Incomprehensible]

Chrome that flashing sparkling like Gucci Collins
When I throw on that boostey you niggas can't stop slobbing
I'm a pretty young, thugging it harder than ever
Fucking it up

So I get paid to do stuff
Never when this cheddar at stake
I'm a chain billionaire, blow a couple of millions on cars
So my family and my homies can ride like stars

I'm all about that money, I don't know about you
I got places I wanna go and things I wanna do
Gotta whole lotta living to do before I die
And I ain't got time to waste, honey, if you hear me

I'm all about that money, I don't know about you
I got places I wanna go and things I wanna do
Gotta whole lotta living to do before I die
And I ain't got time to waste, honey, if you hear me

Now understand me 'cause it's not complex
I'm young and restless with one life to live, so I cash cheques
I'm individually wrapped liked a fresh twinke
So if I cream in the middle, nigga, licky, licky, licky, licky
Become Sponge Bob, absorb me up

Can't just not polish this, I demolish the flow
Niggas astonished when I spit, when I'm pissed I let it flow
I can afford me a Bentley without having to forge a signature
Or getting a nigga to co-sign with me

I get bored quickly, so I saw on the G4 to Cali
For more sticky, live gravey life
Come, hop on this tour with me
Let's get faded for life

I used to save, girl, your cookies are brown even
But I got rid of the whole box and I didn't even turn your looting
I'm shooting at the [Incomprehensible] you lame ass busters
When I smirk, if devils could talk mine would say, "Fuck you"

I'm all about that money, I don't know about you
I got places I wanna go and things I wanna do
Gotta whole lotta living to do before I die
And I ain't got time to waste, honey, if you hear me

I'm all about that money, I don't know about you
I got places I wanna go and things I wanna do
Gotta whole lotta living to do before I die
And I ain't got time to waste, honey, if you hear me

It's so, so Def, how could the cans get dropped
From the mansion to the high rise to the block?
We hot, I rock the white people, Latinos and foreigners
Niggas can't see me when they cry, I scratch out their corneas

I'm warning you, I was born a winner
I scarecrowed off like that Anna Lotono did
Right after she sang "Home in the weares"
After the blizard, that's when I came through with them
Frosted pieces was dripping like icicles

Keep a few of dem precious VDSS next to my skin
So with the best investment jems
Ain't no second guessing it's here
Ain't not question who the best is
Take a lesson from a bitch who is the goodie in years

Never skooted in here, got dem all in here
'Cause dirty honey spin like clean money
From the ATM dummy
So when you done bumping your gums

There's a lot of dough to be made
You should get you sum before it's too late
And you left with none, now it's all about the cash
Where ever it come from, nigga

I'm all about that money, I don't know about you
I got places I wanna go and things I wanna do
Gotta whole lotta living to do before I die
And I ain't got time to waste, honey, if you hear me

I'm all about that money, I don't know about you
I got places I wanna go and things I wanna do
Gotta whole lotta living to do before I die
And I ain't got time to waste, honey, if you hear me

I'm all about that money, I don't know about you
I got places I wanna go and things I wanna do
Gotta whole lotta living to do before I die
And I ain't got time to waste, honey, if you hear me
