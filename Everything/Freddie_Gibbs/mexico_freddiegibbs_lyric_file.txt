They just swing to the side a little bit
J hop up on top, fuck these bitches man, shit’s crazy

New Givenchy coat it's like we’re selling dope
Since I started pimping I don’t sell no more
I got bitches down to 4-0-1 and 4-1-0
I ain’t got no time to sit and talk about so and so
My whip color looks like Rihanna
And all my bitches like designer
We flip Diego like Quintana
That’s why this brother whips a car look like we’re selling dope

I wake up to smoke that kush in the morning
Throw on my rollie
Check my phone, I got a call from my homie
He need that OG
Gangsta D, I run a mob like I’m Tony
I sell that codeine
Just gave all my youngsters Glock-9s and 40s
Them my lil woahdies
Trap my dope spot my OG used to call me
Bag up that doggie
She can’t fuck I drop that bitch on the corner
Yeah bitch I’m balling
Police hit your shit then bitch you don’t know me
No we ain’t homies
Just gave all my youngsters Glock-9s and 40s
Them my lil woahdies, yeah

Bailed out that morning

Put on my rollie
Just gave all my youngsters Glock-9s and 40s
