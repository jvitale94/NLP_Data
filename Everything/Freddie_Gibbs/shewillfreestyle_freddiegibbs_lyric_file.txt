And I can't do right baby, doing wrong was my rite of passage
Caught in this street life, I'm trying to interact with them addicts
100 baggies all wrapped in plastic, I'm just a savage
Hot in these damn streets
Shot this nigga last week
Police on my last nerves
I'm a gon' and make this last serve
Then hit 65 South, then get lower than a bitch
You see me back in the city
That mean I'm back on my dick
Back on that bullshit
Full clip, don't play with a full deck
Cause my package hard up; it ain't made it to my hood yet
Did some niggas dirty, and I can't wait for the day they burn me
Cause I'll show them ho's no mercy
Lord forgive me, I was thirsty
Gangsta Gibbs, fasho...

Them beats baby, uh... Eastside 219.
Midwest in ya mouth, corporate thuggin' fasho.
