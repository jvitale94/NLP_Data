to the black and the Mexican communities..."

"Everything that I was taught that..
only the strong survives; you know meaning well"



"Whether or not you would had to
y'know scrape, bait, or whatever you had to do man
The thing was to get it
It really didn't matter what the means was
or how you had to go and get it
If it means that you had to, step on TEN people
to get a dollar, then you'd step on ten people
and you know this is what I heard constantly
Only the strong survive"
