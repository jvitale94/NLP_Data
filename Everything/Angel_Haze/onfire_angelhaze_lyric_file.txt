Oh yeah, baby don’t take away from me
Oh yeah, sunlight is crawling it’s way through me
Oh yeah, darkness is here, it’ll stay for me

There’s a lot of shit I been waiting to hear, from you
Like would you tell me what the fuck I’m  here to do
Had enough of this shit, there’s a lot on my mind
I just carry the weight as it piles on my spine
I’m  too far from my faith to rely on a God
I’m  too far from my brain, I’m  too out of my mind
I done seen a nigga get his shit knocked back, for real
I done seen a nigga with his fist cocked back
Hit his bitch out back til her shit got cracked
And there’s blood on the floor
I know niggas ignore that the blood in a queen
Runs the same in a whore!
Facts are the facts, we just choose to ignore
I’m not giving myself, WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS FOR, MAN?


Oh yeah, somebody take it away from me
Oh yeah, baby don’t take away from me
Oh yeah, sunlight is crawling it’s way through me
Oh yeah, darkness is here, it’ll stay for me

Man, I swear to God, I almost lost my mind, for real
I left with all the pieces I could find and feel
It’s dark now outside but it’s dark in my mind
I lost all that I love at the same fuckin’ time
And the pressure to be with the pressure to climb
Left me broken in places too desolate to find
Nigga, my brain is a cage!
It’s a place where the beasts that I’m  battling lay
Man, it’s a wrap. I relax in my rage
Like a bat, like a rat, in a trap or a cave
Yo, my thoughts all go black, they get trapped on a page
Then reality comes like a slap to the face
I’m dying to be, man, I’m dying to stay
I’m finally free while I’m flying away
They don’t want war, no!
Won’t let me soar, yo!
Told em before, though!
Told em before, though!

How you throw dirt on a seed and not expect it to grow, yo?
Man, we come from the dirt
Ain’t no shining, just in photos
I don’t wanna live a life on fire
And nothing to show for it
If suffering makes a God, then let me know more of it
