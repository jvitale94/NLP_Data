


Drift off
Meet after dark
Leave what you love with a head full of art
Run to the sun
To wherever you are
Swear to your moon with a cross on my heart
Swallow my thoughts
Let's get lost in the sparks
Of whatever this is
I'm devoted to you
Babe, affection is risk
But do you have my heart?
It's a definite yes
Starlight, the beauty
The visage is bliss
Your nature, your gloomy
Perception is lit
I can see you and me struggling beautifully
Paint the whole scene with good head and good uh
Can we dance forever?


I think I'm obsessed with you
If the world was ending soon
I don't think that I could take it
Yo, what's the point in messing around
If we both know what we've found
Forever, baby, we could make it
You say


It's human nature
We all are dying
But I'm still burning bright and blue
If we're in danger
If time is flying
If we'll both be lifeless soon


Let the candles burn slow
Forever young, I wanna be
In this moment
Oh, we're just making too much love
Until heaven calls, it's just me and you only


Let them candles burn, oh, them candles burning
Let them candles burn, oh, them candles burning
Oh, them candles burning


I took you where the leaves are bright
Fall is your favorite season, right?
I don't think I heard you clearly
Oh, I can barely sleep at night
Funny, you're the reason why
I don't think you need to fear me
We should


We should keep dancing
We should keep trying
We should keep burning bright and blue
Oh, we're in danger
Cause time is flying
And soon we'll both be lifeless too






You told me you ain't wanna do it
Said love was for stupid people and cupid
I swore to you that I could make you lose it
And now I got you dancing to my music
Got you dancing to my music
Shake it, make it, move it
