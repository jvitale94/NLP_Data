And hope that you would notice the crack
Showed you a clearer me and hope that you would mirror me back
And hopes that I could travel the road full of pros
And take that shit as far as it goes
That I could feel the hand of time
Give me a pat on the back
That I could mean everything I often say in my raps
But see love is sorta different in a way that it hurts
But I will push through all the pain and show the weight of your work
And they say that the hottest artists sets us apart
But the fear you wold within is what determines a start
I will never ever end it all you claim that you want
And in the end you found you really never playing your part
It was love at least that's what I figure it was
But it does, some shits that you'd never think that it does
Like make you rip and tell her everything a part of yourself
And show you things you probably never even thought of yourself
You made me hate like every single part of myself
That was ugly all I wanted was just really unatractive baby
You were my whole earth and I was barely on your axis
Maybe if I was a different person you would be affected maybe
I just thought me breaking inside of myself
And it's really not a place on earth to hide from myself
It's hard to find the truth but you barely be lying yourself
And have a face full of pride that's not inside of yourself
So I vow to never let my love outside of myself
It's just a message in the bottle and that bottle's myself
And somehow I still follow things I wish I could say
Like even when I love God's never with us or away
Now I find myself alone because the bottom of my soul
Is just a whole bunch of non sense a whole bunch of conscious
A whole bunch of old shit a whole bunch of problems
A whole bunch of substance a hole full of drama
And when every single hole that's been punctured
The bottom of my soul becomes a whole fucking dumb song
For the time I made mistakes and wasting away
I knew things was just a failed attempt to take your place
And I know this is just a way of letting you go
But I be lying on this beat if I ain't letting you know
You probably never know how it fucking feels when I cry
But here's to every fucking tear in the shield of my eye
Hurt to see behind the smoke once it clears in subside
And every feeling that's inside becomes a feeling you hide
Becomes a part of your past becomes a feeling denied
Becomes a strenght that it's fail becomes a tear that you cry
Becomes a part of your soul becomes the heart of yourself
That you never once touched by any fucking one else
But I'm really just at war with myself
And this is just a fucking place in which I'm pouring myself
So I can't seem 'em walking down my eyes
But you also can't feel the way I drown inside
Can't see the massive amount the weight I hold
The type of shame I know the type of pain I hold
Keep it all inside this very picture frame I wrote
