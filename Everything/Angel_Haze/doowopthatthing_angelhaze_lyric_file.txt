Some girls, some girls are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing

It's been like a week since you've been looking for your friend
The one you let inside like a kitten in the rain
Remember when he told you he was 'bout them other things
Like blunts, like cunts he ain't even at the zein
But girl you acted like you really want a thing
Didn't get the picture like you really out of frame
Remember when he told you he was 'bout them other things
That you were a fool for expecting him to change
But girl I guess you gotta life until you know
You should never love a man that would treat you like a ho
Never love a man that would fucking let you know
Never love a man more concerned with his dough
Always broads, always hoes, always snow, always blow
Never love a man that get you high and leave you low
It began and comprehend in the garbage you should go
Fuck her in her thighs shown you in her glow
Baby girl respect is so definitive
If he can't give it then it ain't no giving in it
I ain't trying to breathe since we all come in sense
But don't be a hard rock when you really are a gem
Don't be a hard rock when you really are a gem
Don't be treated like a 5 when you really are a 10
Don't be fooled by the misconceptions
If he can't treat you right then tell me come again
Come again, come again, come again

Guys you know you better watch out
Some girls, some girls are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing

The second verse is dedicated to the men
More concerned with his rims and his friends in the trench
More concerned with respect and the streets and the taxi
The water black and white like an NBA raff yo
Really should confess that life ain't what it seems
Less concern with the trench more concern with your dreams
See the warning at his door and that morphed as it seems
Don't be a hard rock when you really are a king, king
Can't you see it's really all a scheme
All designed to deter you from those bigger better things
More concerned with your clothes and the whores and joints
That the walls doesn't even see that morals ain't even important
Boy I guess you gotta live until you know
That the boy is not a man till he lives and he grows
Women are the queens that require real men
But how you gonna win when you ain't right within
How you gonna win when you ain't right within
How you gonna win when you ain't right within
Yo nigga, come again

Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out
Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out
Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out

Guys you know you better watch out
Some girls, some girls are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing

Guys you know you better watch out
Some girls, some girls are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing
