And That From Here And There
But Please Trust And Believe
Lil' Mama I See You Gone
Ride For Me So imma Die For You
Is You Wit Me?(Well Let's Get It)


I got your back boy


When were high(T.I.:From when its all good)
When were low(T.I.:To when its all bad)
Boy I promise I will never let you go
Said I got I got I got I got yo' back boy
(Now What you call dat)
I got I got I got I got yo' back boy
(I know you got my back right)
Keep my swagger
Keep it looking good for ya
Keep it looking hood for ya
Shawty if you don't know
I got I got I got I got your back boy
I got I got I got I got your back boy


Hey it's whatever shawty
You ain't gotta ask
Yes, Valentino blouses, summer houses, cash, check!
You can get it you deserve it, flawless diamonds, Louie purses,
My mission's to purchase Earth for her
Present the gifts without the curse
Her pleasure is my purpose
Pleasure to be at your service
We front row at fashion shows
As well as Sunday morning service
But better days or for worse
If I'm paid or I'm hurting in my pocket
She still got a nigga back, know that's for sure
No matter what may occur in life
Everyday with her is like a plus
I'mma love her til she be like that's enough
Pop a bottle get a couple wine glasses fill em up and lift em up
Let us toast to the future here's to us
No, here's to her


They wonder how we do what we do
Panamera Porsches me and you
Stuck to your side like like like glue
Be by your side whatever your gonna do




This is for the women who man caught a sentence
Who gon be there for a minute but they didn't keep their distance
They stayed home waiting on the phone
And on visit day show up looking good smelling better, playing kissy face
Just wanna let you know we appreciate(I appreciate you baby)
Everything you do for us on a day to day
And I know we don't show you all the time but we lucky that you ours
No bouquet of flowers could ever show how much we know we need you
We do all that's in our power just to please you
See boo, fuck them girls, I would leave the World 'fore I leave you
May God say even Eve and Adam ain't got shit on these two





Sure enough
Even though them chicks be hating on us
Still I'm gonna keep her by my side
In whatever situation we gon ride
Make all my fantasies come alive
That's no lie now
Iâ€™ll be, alright just as long as you beside me
10 million dollar mansions won't suffice
If you ain't gon be in there with me at night
The pieces to the puzzles in my life
With all of my good days and all of my bad
You stood by your man(stood by my man) and you know you got my back
Worth every car, every bag, with me they wanna be that
I know what I got at home
I ain't gon never leave that
Them bitches best believe that
