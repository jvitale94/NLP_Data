Just as long as you don't call me broke
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me
"Goodnight it's over with" that's all she wrote
Streets like cold Chicago
Ain't nothing new I've seen it all before
But still I ball like no tomorrow
"Goodnight it's over with" that's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote
I said "it's over with" that's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote, all she wrote
"Goodnight it's over with" that's all she wrote


it's stupid how I go in knowing everybody knowing that I'm
Sewing up the game, destroying like they hate me for it
Eventually see they can't beat then with me they join
Others sworn under oath, or banished left completely scorn
You tell lies, get caught, nigga kick rocks
You never did blend in with the big shots
it's on the fast track, ain't no need for no pit stops
I just laugh at, nigga wishing they were this hot
> Guess they mad at me huh, really pissed off (so)
Better that than pissed on
I'm the Jetsons you the Flintstones
Catch me in the end zone
High stepping prime time
Thought you niggas been on
Ain't no blocking my shine
Like my new air Yeezy's you can see me in the night time
I get rich off livin' life, he check the check reciting rhymes
So call me what you want, wanna hate, have a nice time
While I get stupid paper, hey my dough ain't in its right mind (mind, mind)


Now I don't really care what you call me
Just as long as you don't call me broke
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me
"Goodnight it's over with" that's all she wrote
Streets like cold Chicago
Ain't nothing new I've seen it all before
But still I ball like no tomorrow
"Goodnight it's over with" that's all she wrote


Your staring straight into a barrel of hate Terrible fate,
Not even a slim chance to make a narrow escape
Cupid shot his arrow and missed
Wait Sarah you're late, your train left.
Mascara and eggs smeared on your face
Nights over goodbye, hoe
I thought that I told ya' the spilled nut ain't nothing to cry over
Never shoulda' came within Range of my Rover
Shoulda' known i was trouble soon as I rolled up,
Any chick who's dumb enough out there I blind fold her,
She still comes back to my crib, Must want me to mess with her mind hold up.
She must've took me for some high roller.
But i won't buy her a soda Unless it's rock n' rye cola. (Faygo's cheaper)
Buy you a bag of fritos I wouldn't let you eat the fucking chip on my shoulder.
If you was bleach and I was hair I wouldn't dye for ya
Tryna pull 5 bucks from me is like tryna pulling 5 molars
You get your eyes swole up I'm on my straight grizzly
So why would i buy you a gay ass teddy bear, bitch, you're already bi-polar


Now I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches know as soon as they saw me
it's never me to get the privilege to know
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I'm gonna go
Still I ball like there's no tomorrow
Until it's over and it's all she wrote


The credit roller, curtain closer, movie over with
But don't get mad at me
Go blame the chick who wrote this shit
Yeah life is sure a bitch (bitch)
But she know I'm rich (I'm rich)
That's why she give me what I want and I just throw her dick
Here I go again
I kick this shit, give a damn, got it pouring in
Pay some euro, yeah, ah ha, I'm paid never gon be broke again
See me posted in anything, wearing any chain
Never gon' see me tote in anything
All you gon' see is BANG!
it's so nice where I kick it
Hate you never get to visit
Yeah I'm on another level
But you niggas still can get it
it's all over before you finish
Sorry bro this road we end it
Won't give you the satisfaction of me giving you the business


Yeah I guess life is a bitch ain't it TIP
And each one thinks "Say this shit"
Shirt off my back I wouldn't give you the dirt off my handkerchief
I'm giving these hoes a dose of their own medicine
Let em get a good taste of it
I'm sure you got that relationship memo by now
But in case you didn't
This is so bad, put a sticky note to your forehead and staple it
Life is too short and I got no time to sit around just wasting it
So I pace this shit a little bit quicker
That clock I'm racing in double time
But I still spit triple the amount of insults in a tenth of the time
It may take you pricks to catch on
While you strong arm like Stretch Armstrong
Man I still say K-mart's like there's an apostrophe "S" on it dog
And they say McDonald's isn't a restaurant well I guess I'm wrong
But if you gon tell me that the A&W ain't the spot for the best hot dogs you can get the "F" on dawg


And on my throne I remain, all alone in my lane
I’m as strong as they came
They were gone ‘fore they came
Now I don’t wanna hang, I slap fire with them rap guys
They just wanna sabotage my hustle shawty that's why


Now I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold


I bet they knew as soon as they saw me
"Goodnight it's over with" that's all she wrote


I roll like a desperado, now I never know where I'm gonna go


But still I ball like there's no tomorrow
"Goodnight it's over with" that's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote
I said "it's over with" that's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote, all she wrote
"Goodnight it's over with" that's all she wrote
