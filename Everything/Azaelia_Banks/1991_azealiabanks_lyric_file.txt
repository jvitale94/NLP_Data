Let the litte Bambi run it down, run it down
With a sip of Bailey's
Sip of champy on the alls
Nineteen number naughty baby
Press it on your dial
Sex kitten honeys
No cougars in the house
I'm hush the rumors and the doubt
Came in the game with a beat and a bounce
Never for the fame, my feet on the ground
Cloud number nine, headed to the stars
Baby I ride with my mic in my bra
Baby I recite in the raw the appetite for life and the hunger for the more
The island of Manhattan
I was Born in New York, city never slumbers
I would always dream it never sleep to the hundreds
Coco with the cream in abundance
Million dollar baby you can get it if you want it, what

Let me know what a man man man man want
