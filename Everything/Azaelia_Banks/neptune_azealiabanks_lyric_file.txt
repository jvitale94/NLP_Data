More breeze in your hair, huh?
It's the one that your blick took her chance on
Damn should've have shacked breeze with the champion
Looking for my nigga my feast is the phantom
Phantom this is that young bitch Lil Keke
I needed a plumb with the cheeky
Chill with some fillers from end the shikies
I'm a get 'em get 'em so come hit the repeat


Baby about it
Baby you know
Can I turn you out here?
Can I turn you on?
Tell me now what is your fantasea
Can I hear about it?
Tell me what you need


Hey yo mister come whisper
Hey what's your sign, tell me what else is you into?
We can make your ex girl real real pissed
Take it off your wishlist, can you feel-feel this
I'm the type of girl yo mama warned ya about
Stop fucking with your head, blow your brains all out
Tell me what you like, me a real bad gyal
Give it to you good, make your head turn mad now
Not vanilla we're cinnamon sticks they'll be killing bitches
I'm on my liquorice shit 'til the niggas diggie it stiff
Like Agamartis, riga-rigamortis tipi tipi on his lips
We could take flights to the West Indes
Check her dipping out the sea with a mermaid please
Sip of liquor, bit of rum right under the trees
Tell this London girl, what's your fantaseas, boy?


Everybody got though
I've been bad you know
I-I I'm trying to give that cat toy a kit-kat
I can't fight all night
Al-Alright


Baby about it
Baby you know
Can I turn you out here?
Can I turn you on?
Tell me now what is your fantasea
Can I hear about it?
Tell me what you need

I'm a lady that's eating my pride
But do you know mine all the night
I ain't even gon' be the light
Boy atleast stay on my mind
Can I wet you up?
Baby you know
Am I sexual enough?
Can I wet you up all night?

I don't wanna play with your time-time
Tonight
