Get it in with Miss DuJour
Little bam' little B to get you goin'
That's the way I like it, uh
Give your man a kiss goodnight
In the mix with Miss Delight
And romance, we could freak do what you like
That's the way I like it, uh
(Go!)

She offered me; let's go
We could VIP with some Mo'
Sip drinks for the eve', and smoke some green leaf
We poppin' if we don't know
I think I'm in love
In love with her
She must be from, from up above
Sure that she's born and made, sure you wanna run away
Girl, let's go

Ooh, a wild array of fleur, a floral lush, a view
I thought I'd take you to, take you to
Ooh, a water-way of blue, sky flowers made a hue
They blossom just for you

Aren't you glad you came?
Aren't you glad you came?

Lookin' in the crystal ball
Get it in with Miss DuJour
Little bam' little B that got you goin'
That's the way I like it, uh
Give your man a kiss goodnight
In the mix with Miss Delight
And romance, we could freak do what you like
That's the way I like it

Girl you lookin' kinda fun
And I'm feelin very sexy
When you wanna text me
I'll pick you up and level with you
Delectable, purple barrettes I know
So sexual, come on, come on

Get up, get up
Get up, get up
Get up, get up
Get up, get up
Fuegooo! -

Do you even know
The kind of flower you are? Buttery-cup
Are you Freesia, Violet, Red Rose, or what?

Aren't you glad you came?
Aren't you glad you came?

She knows, she knows
She knows, she knows what I like yeah, oh

Tell me what you want, what you really really want
Fancy cars, dinner in a restaurant
Let's get lost with the one who endorsed
The luxurious life that you can't pay the course for
Who the boss? Tony Danza
Get a divorce from your man, get ya bands up
Put on your corset and cross you to France
You're hot, now little mama put your champ' and ya hands up
