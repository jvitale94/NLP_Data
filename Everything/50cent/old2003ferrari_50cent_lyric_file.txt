So I give them some old shit
What the fuck do I care, its old
Shit I’ll give them some old shit
No, I’ll give them some new shit
I’ll just use my old flow
Looky here muthafucker I’m not playing
Look, look
Looky here muthafucker I’m not playing
Look, look


Wassup,
It’s ‘O11 why that Maybach an ’06
This nigga boo booed up with my old bitch
I put paper before hoes, thats why I’m so rich
I paved the way, long dick, now we all fit
Doc check my temperature, why I’m so cold?
The hood left the left side of my chest froze
I’m more about pimpin’ gettin’ bank rolls
Sitting watch em trickin’ on them stank hoes
We can share love like Kanye and Khalifa
From runways in Milan to big bags of reefer
She alright for a night but don’t keep her
Ask Nas, Kelis was the illest Ether




My belt buckle YSL, my denim vintage
My AP all iced out, my shit authentic
My bread come in by the boat load, thats how I get it
The cops come, say I aint do what you know I did it
I aint trippin’, na-na-na-na I aint trippin’
I am just putting the clip in
I aint at the window looking bitch
I am legend, I am lethal with the weapon
I am 50, I’m putting an end to niggas fucking with me
Yeah, I am back, I am ruler with a iron fist
I am strapped, what y’all niggas gon do with this
Wordplay all day, they say I got a gift
One shot from the fifth, niggas career shift
