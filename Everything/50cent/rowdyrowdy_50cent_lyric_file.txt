New Orleans niggas is rowdy nigga
D.C. niggas is some rowdy niggas
New York Niggas is the fucking wildest nigga

Yo, your man could have ran when I rubbed him but he froze
Son I ain't even rock him to sleep, the nigga dozed
The bitch could have helped you get rich, but she sold
now you heartbroke, that's what you get for loving them hoes
An ill flow with no beat, is incomplete, it's like a stickup kid
running round without no heat, it like a fifth with no kick
a fiend with no hit, a willie with no wit
A bad bitch that won't blow dick
It's like a rollie with no ice, a gambling spot with no dice
Like fucking supermodel bitches and not bustin off twice
I murder any mic device, for the right price, I'm nice
I only say things once, never twice, don't fuck with me



St. Louis niggas is rowdy rowdy
Cleveland niggas is bout it bout it
If they say they gonna kill you nigga, don't you doubt it
Got your gun, well don't leave home without it
The Memphis niggas is rowdy rowdy
Them Shytown niggas is bout it bout it
They'll kill you and act like they don't know shit about it
Leave your body somewhere where no one can find it


Now if I pull out the gat and just push your wig back
I bet niggas will stand around saying "Damn who did that?"
I'm the type nigga to dare you to touch the ?
I'm the type to borrow your gat and wont give the shit back
I'm F to the I - F -T - Y - C - E - N - T
Caress the ass gently, and back up Bentleys
You thought she was pimping, son I was in the Hamptons
in a heart shaped hot tub with the bitch flappin
I plan to take over New York and start expanding
Was Bob Marley singin about tex when he sung "I'm Jammin'"
Nigga fuck with my cash and I'm gonna blast yo' ass
Smash the glock out the stash in the dash in ??
Flee in a flash, lay low let time go past
If you survive the shots I'm gonna find yo' ass
Put the gat to your head and remind your ass
I ain't playing with you, I want my money motherfucker




Yo, some nigga just shot the block up dog, word?
He had the same shit you got on dog, word?
I know you done did it so get the fuck up outta hear, you heard?
I run with niggas that spray and strip and say that shit
You won't let us pump on your block, fuck it, we making it hot
I'm that nigga that call the shots, with the iced out watch
From the cordless cell phone, and the baby blue drop
I got a lot of hungry niggas with me straight from the street
Cause these industry niggas are startin to look like something to eat
They got watches on they wrist that cost like 60 thousand
My niggas live in section eight of public housing
They murder you and keep shit low cause niggas heard of you
