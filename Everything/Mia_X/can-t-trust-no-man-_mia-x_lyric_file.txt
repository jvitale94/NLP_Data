Sistas recognize no matter how you try to understand
Oh noo you can't trust a man
Look here, I'm goin out with tha homies
And dont you even give me no lip like you own me
You want me couked up so you can do yo thang
But now it's time boot up and say some thangs gone change
Like when yo pager rangs
Whats up wit all these codes
You turn tha thang upside down readin stuff from yo hoes
I suppose thats why I got on my clothes
And I ain't even trippin on you
Cause tha things you think is slick really ain't
You think you bein a playa
Cause I work everyday, but I dont pay nan bill
Sex you only when I want
And never do fix a meal
I be that pimpstriss, mackadame with game
Met tha trick indeed to bring tha pain
Cause yo lame excuses
Left you hanging wide open
And I ain't even tryin to cope wit
Yo mental cause it makes no sense
Thats why nothins goin on between us but tha rent
I spent alot of time tryna figure you out
But now I finally understand
You just can't trust no man
You can't trust a man (why they always cheatin)
You can't trust a man (why they mess up tha way they do)
You can't trust a man (why they always cheatin)
You can't trust a man (You can't trust a man)
As long as a trick comes fallin down
It gives me all motion to keep my suit fo tha clown
I'se be like get on down
I'm hella known fo my strut through my town
Suga T here I be its me
Momma always told me dont nathin come free
Always tryna come up on tha rolly hoes
But tha skys tha limit
I keeps my hmm sewed up
They backs up off tha hmm
Because I'm tryna make a buck
Chuggin tha lug cause I be down wit da funkin
Niggas be on my jock like a tree be on tha stump
Packin junk in my trunk
Callin me all on tha top notch to bust some
Lyrical master in tha front
Cause I be that tool with tha classy
Shakin em up gettin em stuck
Supa bad and ain't givin a fuck
Cause thats tha way it goes
You tear me up on tha inside
I hope my hardhead understands
Cause I can't trust no man
Damn even though he's a trip
It's hard to let go cause I'm used to his tricks
I'm scared to find anotha deal with his habits
That might even turn out to be more drastic
I'm mackin and he's ackin on his p's and q's
But fo how long fo real until I get tha blues again
I miss makin dinner fo 2
Candelight, bubble bath and tha rendevous
But I do know I ain't lettin him have his cake
And his ice cream while he eats his steak
I mean I ain't down to share no I can't understand
Some otha chick up in tha mix wit my man
So I'm bounce just to let him see
That if I can't trust him then he can't be with me
