A family live there got put out last month
My uncle sniffing blow while I'm rolling up a blunt
His homey in the basment smoking crack with his aunt
And tonights that night we bout to get right
Piled up in a van with a couple flashlights
This metal crowbars gonna get us through the door
We come to take everything fuck the landlord
So now we at the place skullys on bareface
Bout to leave this bitch bare and strip the whole place
My unc took outside he ripping down the gutters
So we inside tearing up this motherfucker
Bust open the walls just to get the wiring
Took the hot water tank and left over appliances
Aluminum siding and had to come back
Cause the furnace so big it wouldn't fit in the back


Now it's copper bout by the pound
Wire by the inch
Got a check on the first
And it's gone by the 5th
Scrap or Die Nigga
And you might be laughing at it cause you know the shit is true
Rusty flat bed truck the color as doo-dooo
Scrap or Die Nigga


Early morning next day at the junkyard
Got four loads bout to get broke off
But these niggas slick I sweat I'm going off
Put the work on the scale and I swear that bitch was off
Cause I know we had way more than at
Fuck it, split it up ay I get more than at
These niggas always slick on that bullshit
Cheat you out a couple bucks on some dope fiend shit
Now we back in the hood plot the next lick
Got a school closed down and I think we should hit it
Just waiting on my unc to get back from the clinic
And we gone go over there and see what's up with it
Now we up in it taking old computers
Until we fucking heard "Don't move or I shoot ya."
Fucked up hook caught us tryna cash in
Now we gotta B&E case and trespassing
