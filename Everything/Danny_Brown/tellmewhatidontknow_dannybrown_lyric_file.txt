

Street smart, Ph.D
Dropped out for a nigga degree
Not on me
Keep the doubles off me
Cause we was living in shit
Couldn't afford property
Lil nigga getting fronting from OGs
Oz of OG bagged up in the Pelle
In a school hall way on a burner celly
Leaving out of class early caught a cell for 20
How long will they last?
Never ending race, chasing cash
One lane going wrong way til I crash
Teacher find my sack, going nowhere fast

Tell me what I don't know
Last night homie got killed at the liquor store
Shot my nigga on the way to get a Swisher
Breaking down the weed when the call got received

We was so ambitious
All we really wanted was new Jordans and some bitches
Flashing bankrolls in the club taking pictures
Thinking we was grown men, really lil niggas
Jumping dope fiends that's owing us for credit
Taking turns catching shells things copacetic
Slice your tomato if you owe us for the lettuce
Running through the sack of D sorta like Jerome Bettis
Now heed the outcome
Hit the block, hit the stash and they found some
Lock us all up for a bag of some
Now we in the county writing letters I miss you

Tell me what I don't know
Hood raid came through kicking down the front door
Now we facing judge, got us sitting up in court
Gave us all probation now we smoke Newports
Tell me what I don't know
Hood raid came through kicking down the front door
Now we facing judge, got us sitting up in court
Gave us all probation now we smoke Newports
Tell me what I don't know
Tell me what I don't know
Tell me what I don't know
Tell me what I don't know

And we was so gone ho
Wet a nigga up like he got his poncho
On the block all day chasing that cilantro
Hood raid kicking on the front door
It's like a cycle
You get out, I go in, this is not the life for us
It's like a cycle
You get out, I go in, this is not the life for us

Tell me what I don't know
Last night homie got killed at the liquor store
Shot my nigga on the way to get a Swisher
Breaking down the weed when the call got received
Tell me what I don't know
Hood raid came through kicking down the front door
Now we facing judge, got us sitting up in court
Gave us all probation now we smoke Newports
Tell me what I don't know
Tell me what I don't know
Tell me what I don't know
Tell me what I don't know
Tell me what I don't know
Tell me what I don't know
Tell me what I don't know
Tell me what I don't know
Tell me what I don't know
