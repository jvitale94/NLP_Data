I will eat on them pajamas
Bite all on it like piranha
When it comes to that vagina
Baby girl you could be my dinner
Just lean back, and get it
Won't stop licking til you tell me quit
Let me suck on that clit while you follow my head
Baby girl I know you're with it, ball with me
Fall back on that outfit or something
And I love your thighs I can't deny
Work it like Twerk team and I think my dick want to be the sound
Rolling balls til' my dick hard, didn't say heard like a missed call
I don't really look like I'm trying to fuck and I probably won't care about her tomorrow
Dammit ho, what you trying to do "pour a deuce lets get chopped and screwed"
Fools gold, and you know, and Balmain mark down the shit
Smoking on that freeze, nigga
Got a nigga, amnesia nigga
Comatose and I need a dose
Wanna get behind that ass you got
Dipping to that Diplo
Throw it right when they play tonight
Looking right, thinking of dimes and I think I am gon' fuck her tonight
She lookin' ready to go, and fosho ainâ€™t gon stop
With her hands on the floor and her feet on the wall


Pop the pussy on a hand stand Ha-ha-ha-hand stand 
(Shake that ass for a gangsta nigga)
Pop the pussy on a hand stand Ha-ha-ha-hand stand 
(Shake that ass for a hipster nigga)


Hands on the floor and her feet on the wall
And she pop that pussy like she ain't afraid to fall
When her hands on the floor and her feet on the wall
And she pop that pussy like she ain't afraid to fall

Let me see what you're working with
Don't stop girl keep twerkin' it
I'm watching you and I'm wondering if you could do that with my dick in it
She throw it back like a fire ball
Hit it up, order like a house call
Want to eat the cat, be from the back, then give that ho a mouthful
Hundred dollar pills we rolling, ass in the air she working
Don't care when we rolling, don't care when they rolling
Hundred dollar pills we rolling, ass in the air she working
Don't care when we rolling, don't feel when we rolling
Pop the pussy on hand stand, record that on my Handycam
That uncut, ludicrous
Feel that monkey I go Orangutan
You ain't met a nigga like this before
Eat it from the back, suck on ya toes
The way I put my mouth on it that pussy wet feeling 
Throw it back to that A-track, one hour to that Baauer
Now she got my dick hard, and I want to fuck her in the shower
Looking ready to go, oh fo' sho' I ain't go soft
Got her hands on floor, and her feet on the wall
