Fake molly, fair body
We get it popping when she at her best
Cause it's a party when she bout it
Shots dropping now she out her dress
And girls coming out the closet
A superstar on some private shit


Make a promise not to tell nobody
If she hot enough to get it, well get it girl
You know what it is, I don't get offended girl
Mmm, mmm
Come and kick it with a player, enjoy your world
You better open up, let me hit it and join your world
Like the ceiling, reveal it before I kill it
She tried to go and tell the city I loved her but no, I didn't
Fuck nigga no I didn't, get comfortable doe eye dipping
Then wonder what she was feeling
Her number does not exist in my phone, and I overlooked her
Her friends were looking me over
And I ain't got time for nothing
But you to come out them clothes and get naked


She gon do it all for a player like me
I bet if she could she would make it naughty
You know what she do when she hang around me
She like to get naked
She don't have to worry 'bout shit for one night
All because we know we only getting one life
Probably because her momma don't know what she like


Yeah take it easy
Strip tease me
Let's get naked
