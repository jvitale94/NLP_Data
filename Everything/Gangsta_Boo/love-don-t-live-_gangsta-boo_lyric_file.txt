Love Don't Live
Chorus ~  you abandoned me 
                 Love don’t live here anymore
                 Just a vacancy
                 Love don’t live here anymore
                 
This is dedicated to all my ladies in relations ~ peep this out
 
I’m a lady who be keepin it real 
You don’t care 
Take time out 
See how I feel
When I be ridin in tha SUV I’m thinkin of you
When I be smokin on my hydro boy I’m thinkin of you
You got me goin like oooh
I’m feelin tha rush 
I like ta fuck
Doggy style in tha back of tha truck
So boy wassup?
It’s whatever when it comes down to you
Well it was until you made it clear that I ain’t for you
You just abandoned me
You left me strandedly 
Heartbroke constantly
Hearin love songs on the radio 
That remind me of you
They say gangsta ain’t posed to cry
But I’m sheddin tears & I’m a gangsta until I die 
I’m tellin ya boy 
They say no pain & no gain
How they call me playa because you teachin me all your game
I say I ain’t changed but then again just peep me out
Aay yo I don’t think this shit is gonna work I’m ready to leave & GET OUT

Chorus

Just be a man about it
You don’t have to lie to me
Nigga leave my house
You can get the fuck away from me
Take yo fuckin car keys
Get yo fuckin clothes too
Nigga that’s my credit card
Hold up thats my bank book
While you out here cheatin on me
I’m getting my own creepin on
(Hey girl why you ain’t answer that god damn phone)
Ooh why nigga
I was gone
Nigga buy my whole kill
Pay my own light bill
I don’t need you
Got my own fingers for my sex thrill
Shit I’m a mack
Playa you ain’t heard my real name?
Misses pimpin thang
Pussy power to tha fuckin brain
If you wanna play get in tha shower & stroke yourself
I ain’t tha one to be messed with
Pimpin til my death
Slip in it slip out
Remember how that used to be?
I would get so wet
When you put your love inside of me
But that’s the past now
No more  freaky tale nights
No more poppin X or a sex asshole type

Chorus

I ain’t tryin to get caught up in yo games
Personally I think that shit is lame 
What you doin last night & then when you wanna hit
I ain’t givin yo ass shit
You be just another trick
On my list of busters
Diamond clusters 
Rings on 
Game needs to be sold not told with yo frozen heart
Boy you tore us all apart 
Now XXX partner
Ballin nigga from tha park
With yo 7 in cock
Give it to me don’t stop 
I keep fallin for you 
Hypnotize bought to get my props 
But now I’m single 
Pussy back tight 
I ain’t fuckin with no jigalos
Niggas ain’t right
They wanna cunt now 
They wanna cunt lata
They ain’t call yo ass then
They ain’t call yo ass lata
That’s how it goes
I’m out tha do holla back 
Hit me on my 2-way when you ready
That’s down on that
