(chorus 10x)
Don't stand, don't stand so close to me

[lord infamous]
Runnin' to the beats, done pushed you off cause we like greedy
When I'm shootin' pool, I blast... 'cause I'm feisty
Lord and here comes the two to the three and four
Five six after seven
Fucked up, snorted out, drunk, and them I'm blown
But when we tear the club up
You best believe you won't come out that hole
Cool, when you hit the ones is gone, on the blow
But mind you, you best die then fuck with my cocked 3 time

[dj paul]
Nigga, nigga, it's the tear da club up thugs with the gangsta boo
>from three 6 mafia, mafia now what'cha you wanna do
Gangsta party where the fuck
Lucky luchi set 'em up
Put your goods in the bag
A heavy boys get 'em up
Fools all up in my face
On some prepared to take my place
Or be in my shoes
Or find out it ain't that safe
Up in the club we clean house like a renovator
Bust 2 times in his mouth
My glock can't see you later

(chorus 8x)

[juicy "j"]
It's that nigga from the north
Smokin' on a short newport
If you wanna get high with me
Roll a blunt and light the torch (nigga)
Strap it on my waste
3-5-7 nigga play
For you robbers who wanna rob
And you haters out to hate
Wave your guns up in the air
And cock 'em back if it's a must
If you don't give a fuck
Pull the trigger and let it bust (fool)
It's the tear da club up thugs
Buckin', blastin' in your club
Never ever showin' love
Just pullin' guns and poppin' slugs

[gangsta boo]
It's a two game table
Ok ya heard it from fatal
But I'm not robbin' your cradle
I'm gettin' closer to be your neighbor
Unfadeable to any motherfucker who cross my path
A wrath full of blood bath
Take it with questions last
I leave you wet
Nigga, in a split second
Waitin' for the next to run up with my bullet to? 
Be on my chest the smith and wesson got you niggas just guessin'
Will she leave a bloody mess with the family upsettin' (ugh)

(chorus 8x)

[gangsta boo]
The fuckin' message that I'm stressin' is I don't fuck around
Cause on my side of town niggas beat the fuck outta clowns
Don't say no more
Open wide roy, leo's a lion
Got you cryin' cause excitement over shit that I'm writin'
I'm quick to take a bitch, nigga
Take the nigga bitch
Act scared, you done heard about the lady from the six
What you do know won't hurt you in the long run
What you do know that I keep 'em risin' like the sun, ask crunchy blac
I'm a nigga know that's with me
How this lady got you bitches faded oh so easily
What you tryin' to be
A little naughty nigga that you not
Tryin' to get popped with the glock that I keep in stock
I can't be playin' with bitches
They can't be playin' with me
Cause I don't play with all the motherfuckers kids, you see
I try too hard to be the pimpin' lady that I am
Pam porter reporting you playa hatas
With a plan of gettin' ya
