Gangsta Boo
Miscellaneous
None For Me
Verse1(G.B)- Baby, you always be tryin' to play me. But nigga, ya game ain't good enough for me. Boo likes a challenge. I'ma wise and smart bitch. Sex ain't my life, got other shit to do. My life don't surround yo ass boo. I love you, ya my baby. But sex ain't everything to me. 

Chorus- You keep tellin' me you want this. You keep tellin' me you want this shit. You keep tellin' me to suck your dick. Sorry, maybe another time baby. No,No,No,No, None For Me. 

Verse2(Master P)- Babe, in a relationship. When ya fuckin' ya girl. She gotta suck ya dick. Cock, juicyfruit and winterfresh. So make cum on down, to my juicy flesh. It's called payin' respect to your man. Now ho, do ya understand. I'ma dirty south nigga, with a big ass dick. And i need a Ho to come get this shit. Whenever I ask for that favor. You be like "Not tonight,P, maybe later."

Chorus

Verse3(G.B)- Nigga, don't even front about our ways. You know you hate it when you don't cum for days. I love you and I wanna be wit' ya. But cock-suckin' ain't a daily chore for me, bra. Once in a while, I can use a little fuck. But not on a daily basis do I wanna suck.
