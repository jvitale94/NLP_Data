When you hear that Han
Aye, I said hey pretty lady
Skrt!


Uh
He said that I spark his interest
I'm not easy to impress
Ain't no dress code to this fresh
Ain't no lay away on this dress
Thrilla in Manila
Got the white chinchilla
Got the ice cream dripper
Pussy tastes like vanilla
I know you tryna beat it up like godzilla
But how many licks will it take till you get to the middle


Hey pretty lady
Girl, you can be my baby
I think you so underrated
And I can't wait to hit it, hit it
Now baby come and get it, get it

Sex-sex-sex-sexy, I want your love
Sex-sex-sex-sexy, I want your whoa
Sex-sex-sex-sexy, I want your love
Sex-sex-sex-sexy, I want your whoa

Go get it, go get it, go get it, girl Haan!
Go get it, go get it, go get it, girl Haan!
Go get it, go get it, go get it, girl Haan!
Go get it, go get it, go get it, girl Haan!


I'm a dirty, dirty tease, it's hard to please me
High class bitch, I ain't easy
Wine from Burgundy, on my leisure
Hunnid on the dash, bye Felicia
Running through the m's like a money counter
Fly over ya city like I'm in that chopper
Way too fly, no they can't top her
Hustle every day, no they can't stop her


Hey pretty lady
Girl, you can be my baby
I think you so underrated
And I can't wait to hit it, hit it
Now baby come and get it, get it


So sophisticated
That's an understatement
Pull up to the party looking better than your main chick
Damn, I'm such a sexy bitch
Make it look so effortless
Hoe, don't say my name unless you putting some respeck on it


Hey pretty lady
Girl, you can be my baby
I think you so underrated
And I can't wait to hit it, hit it
Now baby come and get it, get it

Sex-sex-sex-sexy, I want your love
Sex-sex-sex-sexy, I want your whoa
Sex-sex-sex-sexy, I want your love
Sex-sex-sex-sexy, I want your whoa
