Don't ask me how I get it
I get it, right?

I, I, I get it
I, I, I get it
I, I, I get it, yeah
(I run me up)

I, I, I get it
I, I, I get it
I, I, I get it, yeah
(I run me up)

The bank don't stop
â€~Cause they put me in cuffs
Still made money up in the can
What the fuck?

I'll have a baby to buy you, baby
If you a billionaire
Write the cheque before I come
Just sign right here

I'ma stay rich, I ain't gonna die
Tryin' to spend my shit
I'ma die
Tryin' to spend your shit

Now a days these rap niggas
On some feminine shit
So I guess Queen B
Gon' be the man of this shit

Laughin' at these rap bitches
On some amateur shit
They're better off makin' a livin'
On some janitor shit

Who the hell is this chick?
She been out kinda long
Had one hot song, I'm sorry, I missed it
Too busy being conceded puttin' on my lipstick

Takin' trips out in Cali', chillin' with the Hiltons
Yeah, I'm chillin' Kim top billin'
With the top down
Pourin' money through the ceilin'

I get it
The lifestyle you only rap about
I live it
My man buy me cars that you hoe's be rentin'
I'm classy like a Phantom, you a Honda Civic

Lil' Kim got your whole bank
Stop, I get it
