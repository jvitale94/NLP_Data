I need you, got to have you
Yeah, whatever

I was sitting at the bar when this real horny guy came over
  (Hi how are you doing? How are you?)
He said, "Won't you let me take you on a ride in my Range Rover"
I said, "You can't be serious, my Bentley's right outside
And plus your breath smells like shit anyway"

Oh I need you, oh, gotta have you, oh
Just wanna touch you, oh, I need your love, yeah
Right now

Everybody's on the dance floor and this fool is still behind me
I am dipping through the crowd now hoping that he doesn't find me
He said, "Baby, where you going?"
(Lil' Kim I love you)
Then he grabbed me by the hand and dipped my body to the ground
And said

"I need you, oh, gotta have you, oh
Just wanna touch you, oh, I need your love, yeah
I need your love, right now"

Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Dut, dut, dut, dut, dut, dut, dut, dut
Dut, dut, dut, dut, dut, dut, dut, dut

See the party don't stop till the casket drop
Like a six double O with the plastic drop
Damn, is that all you got hmm baby, give it one more shot
Got a body like what, what, what, watch me shake my butt, butt, butt
Like it when you sing that song, oh I know you wanna see my thong
  (Oh baby, oh baby)

I need you, oh, I want you, oh
Just wanna touch you, oh, I need your love, yeah

Right now, right now, right now, right now
  (Girl, I need your love babe)
I need your love, I want your love
