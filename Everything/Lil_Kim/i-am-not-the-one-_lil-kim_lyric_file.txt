Warning, warning, warning, the drama queen is in the building,
The drama queen is in the building
I'm not the one, I'm not the one
Everybody wanna talk about kim,
It ain't nothing soft about kim
Everything you walk about kim,
The [?] I've been
Picture me being broke and I can auction my pen, please
I ain't never worry about him, I can worry about me
But I ain't worry about them
I'd rather see you coughing up flem
Off with they heads, guillotine kim so it's off with they limp
Why I pop [?] with my men
When I was up in the pen, my fans wrote me
They said queen keep doing it thing right [?] so we can [?] this
The rest of you [?]

See a I downfall, so I don't come around y'all
Now I'm beyond rich, to spit [?] be gone bitch
Bitch couldn't walk a mile in my louis vuittons
Me against you that's [?]
[?] be about the bomb, taliban
Coming through the north trench, caliban
Bitch use [?] the ghetto [?]
Sipping down [?] on palm beach
Original orgy, my [?]
Play [?] with the irs family
While these [?] hoes trying to get fancy
I live the life of a queen I'm [?] bitch
Now bow kiss the ring, money, power, respect it's all [?]
All I see is dollar signs, all I hate is tcha ching
Bow into your fears [?] didn't realize you fucked with the wrong one
I'm not the one, I'm not the one
I'm not the one, I'm not the one [?]
