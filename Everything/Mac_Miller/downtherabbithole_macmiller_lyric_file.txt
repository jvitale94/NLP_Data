And it's the best day ever... 
So pack your motherfuckin' bags, cause we gonna go 
So pack your motherfuckin' bags, cause we gonna go 

Hey, I got a... 
Cup of Henny, 
Joint of good, 
Not gettin' any sleep, even though I should. 
Catch a early flight, 
Hit another city, 
For a concert full the fans who be fucking with me. 
Countin' hundreds, fifties 
Groupy hoes, 
That all love to show me how they drop they booty low. 
Two in ones, 
That's a Manaja twa, 
Watch they bras come off, have me saying LA-DE-DA. 
Rock and Roll, 
Living life, 
Gettin' head, 
Get it twice. 
It feels like I've been drunk for the 11th night. 
Don't know how I'm gonna wake in time to catch this flight. 
All these bitches in the front row try to dress alike. 
They do a lot of barking, but they never bite. 
They lookin' at me like I'm gonna have some sex tonight. 
And yes I might if it's alright. 

Cause I got what you need if you lookin' for a trip, 
Escape the world a lil bit, maybe go and get a grip, 
This all can be a drug, just please don't take too much, 
you can have it free of charge, though I do it for the love 

Cause first I, 
Take a breathe, 
Then let it out, 
Hear them clap a little while, then I take my bow. 
I'm on my job, 
But maybe out my mind, 
Got some liquor and some weed, it's about that time. 
Anyway you name it, I'm entertainment, I make it, I'll admit I'm kind of famous, 
My life is like a vacation, cause day out and day in these hotels, day inns, 
Travel navigation, I switch up my location. 
They going without shavin', the road life's a bitch, 
But fuck it, this the good life, so for no life, I switch. 
Got my money coming faster than these women I get into, 
Can't tell me how to live my life, chill fool, I've been cool 
I'm type of dude, 
Pretty cool, kind of nice, not rude, 
Cause some hoes who like my tunes, 
Get front row and show their boobs. 
Party every night, they worry that I'll blow the fuse, 
But I'm way too young and don't know rules. 

Okay (Cause), I got what you need if you lookin' for a trip, 
Escape the world a lil bit, maybe go and get a grip, 
This all can be a drug, just please don't take too much, 
you can have it free of charge, though I do it for the love
