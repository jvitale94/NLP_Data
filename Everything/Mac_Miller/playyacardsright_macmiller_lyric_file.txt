So she came up to me and asked my name 
I said it's funky mac I don't play no games 
If you wanna come home with me tonight 
You better play ya cards right. 

I came to rock right now 
I'm the best and I came to get down 
I've been known to rock a microphone 
She got a boyfriend but left him home 
See I got style, so yes I brag 
The things I do just make them mad 
Download new kicks to my ipad 
Why ya girlfriend look like she's dressed in drag 
You a fag, this is forever, ladys in love with my agenda 
My names something these girls remember 
She write hers down, return to sender 
I don't need it, thinking she can keep her secrets 
One night only that's how I treat this, sleepin 
Bitch please make me some breakfest 
And then leave. 


So she came up to me and asked my name 
I said it's funky mac I don't play no game 
If you wanna come home with me tonight 
You better play ya cards right. 

Ya see I came to rock right now 
I'm the best and I came to get down 
I've been known to rock a microphone 
Girls odishon to bring them home 
See I might chose, so just go with it 
Her mom adores me, her dad thinks I'm a nitwit 
It don't really matter I'ma have her fall in love 
I need my botty brains botty? and she all of the above 
Relationships, I hate that shit 
Got one night only so make it quick 
You see me out, wanna take a pic 
Fuck me once, wanna date and shit. 
I ain't that rich, but I got friends 
Make a sandwich, get me fed 
Decided right now don't got all night 
This the life so play ya cards right. 


So she came up to me and asked my name 
I said it's funky mac I don't play no game 
If you wanna come home with me tonight 
You better play ya cards right.
