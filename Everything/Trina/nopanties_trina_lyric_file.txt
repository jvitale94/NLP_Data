But I can't suck a dick
And get my lipstick smeared
Fuck nigga don't be grabing my braids

And all day Miss Trina zem zema

Tinted windows and some tens

To even take your mens look a here

Speak for you touch me you gonna treat
And put some sandtins on my feet
Take me to the beach

Bitch you ain't gotta like me
Oh you his wifey
I think your man like me
He had me in the car
With his hand on my bra
Breathing in my face 
Saying
TRI-NA
I ain't trying a disrespect
I'm just trying to keep you in check
See I ain't done yet
Shit I'm the type of chick break
Up happy homes like Trick 
So mo easy joe you so and so
I'm a superwoman you don't know
Damn I look good 
Talk trash in your hood
And if you man want you 
Daddy would Missunderstood 
Slip and slide Miss Trina 
Been sold out the arena 
Like a rock and roll singer
You hate me you get the finger
All up in my gut playa what

Hey playa whats the word
Watch my hips don't you like these cruves
I wanna crib in the deep suburbs
2 dogs and a mocking bird 
Versae sprad on my water
And give me some head give me some head
Miss Trina likes kicks all red and I'm the first to say 
I'm the badest chick
