And when I'm not cheating every night it's an argument
I know that's something that I really shouldn't do
But I want my cake and wanna eat it too, we both cheating.
I'm cheating and I'm in love of who I'm cheating with
And when I'm not cheating every night it's an argument
I know that's something that I really shouldn't do
But I want my cake and wanna eat it too, we both cheating.

I cheated, I cheated, we both played this game, that we both eat it,
You are under fit it, walked around so I seat it,
Temporary love is what we pretended, we need it
Or are we really pretending 'cause now I can't believe it,
Look how I feel this harder, we're yelling now we're living
Knowing it would never last it's only for a season,
Now you go back to her, and I go back to him,
When I think of how you do me, I stop hating him,
I don't know if I'm there, and you know either make me
'Cause is just convenient, just to say that he's my nigga,
Or is it just convenient just to say that he a bitch,
And when you're doing her, you think of this, ya.



Every night is an argument when I'm not with you
I got a guilty conscious 'cause I know my nigga see you,
Late in night I'm not in the mood, I'm acting funny
Every conversation I'm talking rude I'm acting funny
When he be touching on me, I swear it's not the same
I'll remember one time I call... your name,
I played it all though, but whose to really blame,
One plan to deck the cards, it's a dirty game,
They say pout about it, is he a good nigga
The temptation got me turned up for real nigga,
I'm cheating and I'm cut up in the mix,
Tell me when you with it girl, do you think of this?



I know that I want
But this temptation is taking over me,
I mean the way that you feel,
I feel defeat.
He's really good at,
He doesn't deserve that
But I can't...
