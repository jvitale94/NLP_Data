Sex is what I'm talkin 'bout, sex is what I'm talkin 'bout 
Ahhh.. 

 
I'm not gon-na hold on no 


I ain't talkin 'bout a 70/30 (no way, no way) 
Or a 60/40 (uh-uh, uh-uh) 
Talkin 'bout a (50/50 when the room is empty) 
(And the clothes come off, I'm doin you and you doin me) 

 
First thangs first, Miss Trina, ducks all the lames in the game 
I'm quick to put a nigga to shame 
Fo' sayin my name, cause umm that'll get you nowhere 
but West Bubblefuck, with a kick in yo' nuts 
So if you wanna hit the guts, then you gotta play yo' cards right 
Go against the odds, cut me like I'm hard white 
I train bitches like Tyko 
To get the dick then the money out these niggaz goin psycho 
That's if you like a man, he kinda tight though (shit) 
I don't give a damn, I'm tryin to get you right though (what) 
Got vibes retired like David Rob 
Heartthrob forever, cute and thicker than ever 
Sheeeit, you know you need a chick like me 
Own cars, own house, own shit like me 
Uhh, see me and only me 
I'm the real Queen of this shit, truly yours, "Baddest Bitch" 

 
I'm not gon-na hold on no 

 

 
Uhh, you know I'm still in my prime 
So, give me some lovin I could feel in my spine 
And do it to me like you said you would 
Talk dirty but don't hurt me, do my body good 
Show me love and give me hugs, let me cop a squeeze 
Burn a few trees and let you get on top of me; 
strength on that D - freaky deaky in the bedroom 
I'm a lady by day by night I need my legroom 
Wanna let my hurr down - get a glass of Chardonnay 
I don't mean to drink it fast but homey pardon me 
Calm your nerves I got you shakin hyperventilatin 
Lack of preperation and waitin for the penetration 
Concentratin with every moment when we have relations 
Sensations give me temptations, so gimme more ain't no limitation 
We lovemakin in the late night 
Ain't goin home 'til the daylight - so fuck me right nigga 

 
I'm not gon-na hold on no
