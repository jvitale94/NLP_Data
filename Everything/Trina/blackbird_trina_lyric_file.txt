They fall, they get, they get it, they ball off
Streets, streets, holliday, we all gonna stand,we all going down, they brag,
They fall, they get, they get it, they ball off

You can find me on the late nights,
But I’m running is the streets cause, streets cause
I’ll be riding on the late nights
Little mama is a black bird, little mama is a black bird
Little mama is a black bird
Catch me riding in the great lights, little mama is a black bird

Black diamonds, black furs, looking at the car, backs hurts
Black diamonds, black furs, looking at the car,
Black diamonds, black furs, looking at the car, backs hurts
Them broke bitches get on my nerve
I’m the main course, you’re the all dirt
Miss Trina, bad bitch, action nigger, bad bitch
He fucked and never call that pussy average
Hold my pockets spreader than my ass is
All my bitches, made chicks, don’t try to say shit nowhere to stash it
Day time,  is a pace, watch out we put love, these bitches ain’t ready

You can find me on the late nights,
But I’m running is the streets cause, streets cause
I’ll be riding on the late nights
Little mama is a black bird, little mama is a black bird
Little mama is a black bird
Catch me riding in the great lights, little mama is a black bird, black bird

Curtain closes, I don’t see you bitches
He treat me like a kush he keep me with him
It’s a man’s world but I  it
It’s hard work, I’m dedicated
I’m from the streets but I’m educated
I been getting money, I ain’t never hated
Fix your face hoe, what you mad I made it
All you bitches below me because I elevated
Miss Trina, bad bitch, action nigger, bad bitch
All day at the  watch how I blow them, these bitches ain’t ready

You can find me on the late nights,
But I’m running is the streets cause, streets cause

Sicker my sound  making millions and moving house

No need for words when you’re a black bird
Secret society what he get us is powerful
Sexing my working back like they’re cut from the 
This hate county  I have pockets you getting served
No need for words when you’re a black bird

You can find me on the late nights,
But I’m running is the streets cause, streets cause
I’ll be riding on the late nights
Little mama is a black bird, little mama is a black bird
Little mama is a black bird
Catch me riding in the great lights, little mama is a black bird, black bird.
