I ain't even empty handed I beg your pardon
If im departing im taking everything coz ill be damned if another bitch wore your last name
Put your hands up ladies if you want it all 
Say I want it all 
I want it all 

I went looking for ur phone when I shouldn't have coz I found just what I was looking for
A new number says its kelly should I call it or should I just ignore
Now im sittin here wondering when you're coming home
Then I thought about it everything thats going on
I gotta leave this relationship but im not leaving here
So let me get my list out
What do I want other than this house
First off let me put your bitch out call me crazy if you want her buh I don't care
Now back to my list
Gotta have the house check
Do I want the car check
Do I want the money check
Gotta have it all check
And I deserve it hope it was worth it
And I don't think that I'll be needing your service

I need his house (I need his house)
I need his car (I need his car)
And then the bank (and then the bank)
I want it all (I want it all)
I gave you all my love and got nothing in return
So now I want it all (I want it all)
I want it all (I want it all)
Gimmi the house (gimmi the house)
Gimmi the car (gimmi the car)
I want it all (I want it all) 

If im gonna have to hurt u gonna feel it how I feel it
Play the cards how I deal it
You know I was the realist
Coz the way you going bout this like I never meant shit
Now you want the other bitch coz we had an arguement
Ok roll the dice ima show you how it go
And since u wanna do it dirty watch this fire crack a blow
This aint no tip or tap shit its all about the principe
How you expect to leave me without a comma or decimal
Pay me for my pain
Pay me for my time
Nigga you can say the bullshit coz everything is mine
From the house in west pond to the yatch in burlese
U can keep ur sad face baby hand me them keys
Coz the shit you said it did it
Threw me way off track
But when a woman is fed up no it ain't no turning back
Only thing gonna make me smile is if I feel my satisfaction
Is seeing you hurt is fucken you suffering while im relaxing

So now I need his house (I need his house)
I need his cars (I need his cars)
And then the bank (and then the bank)
I want it all (I want it all)
I gave you all my love and got nothing in return
So now I want it all (I want it all)
I want it all (I want it all)
Gimmi the house (gimmi the house)
I need the car (gimmi the car)
I want it all (I want it all) 
Put your hands up ladies if you want it all 
Say I want it all 
I want it all 

I need his house
I need his car
And then the bank
I want it all
I want it I want it
I earned it
Your a liar your a cheater
Gimmi what I need
I'll leave you alone if you gimmi what I please
Ooohhh I want it all
Ooohhhhhoohhhhh be a man about it
Put your hands up ladies if you want it all (you know what you did to me)
Put your hands up ladies if you want it all 
Say I want it all 
I want it all
