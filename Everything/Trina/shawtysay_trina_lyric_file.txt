Shawty shawty say the n**** that she with ain't shit 

Hes a beast hes a dog
Hes a to the left problem
Tryna thel them lies
Hopin that I won't solve em
I call him
Voicemail pickin straight up
Should I gps him
Damn right staight up
My mind keep tellin me
I'm bout to earn a felony
You'll never get the best of me
Rushin fast tryna see
Why the maybachs top is somewhere where you'll never be
3 o clock in the mornin
You should be next to me
I hope it ain't kimberly
It better not be tiffany
It's prolly that ebony
How this dude be tryin me
Juss wined and dined everything is fine
It don't work like that I put in too much time
Damn I'm in shock can't believe what I see
He ain't with that one chick
He in the back with all three
Low down dirty ass cheatin lame n****
Don't make me put this finger on this trigga!

Shawty say the n**** that she with ain't shit
Shawty shawty say the n**** that she with ain't shit 

Naw I ain't shoot him
Cause he ain't worth that
The purse he bought yesterday
I took that shit back
I got them 12 stacks
I bleached all his clothes
So he knows what's gonna happen when he mess with other hoes
I burned all his shoes
I swiped all his cards
Ordered gucci off the internet and sold it in the yard
Sucker went dead broke in just three hours
After the transaction his house turned towers
I called his momma up she said she feel my pain
She told me if she was me she would of did the same thing
Yea I kept the ring juss switched the finger
To the middle one cause it's f u n****
Was a diamond in the ruff
I ain't never played tuff
Til you got outta line doin all that dumb stuff
This n**** had it good I could sworn dis was it
Come to find out that n**** wasn't shit

Shawty say the n**** that she with ain't shit
Shawty shawty say the n**** that she with ain't shit 

Ladies if ya know a n**** cheatin and he late night creepin
Telephone stay ringin with the boys every weekend
Takes a look and peekin making sure you ain't seein
Then you know that n**** ain't shit
If he don't answer his phone and his car ain't parked at home
And you know he love to bone cause he hate to be alone
And you catch him with a shone and you say that he is grown
Then you know that n**** ain't shit
If his momma lie for him and his brother do to
And his sister say girl he gonna do what he do
And you know hes tellin lies tryna make you think they true
Then you know that n**** ain't shit
If he say that he was workin and you juss came through
And his boss say he called in with the flu
When you check his voicemail some chicks sayin where are you
You know that n**** ain't shit

Shawty say the n**** that she with ain't shit
Shawty shawty say the n**** that she with ain't shit
