Speedin on the highway, diamonds on my wrist
I’m looking for a fly what you know about this
I’m a bad bitch, spotting these hoes I’m a rich bitch

Yeah, it ain’t nothing, you know I been something
I been getting money I’m grown ass woman
Getting paper and the real niggers love it
Blue one point something and the belly touch the budget
I came a long way from riding in the  to the whole stash
In the benz like fuck it!
got niggers doing what I want like puppets
And I hate it going hate so I’m thinking nothing of it
