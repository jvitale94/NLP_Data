But tonight I'm in my zone.
Said he need some attention, I don't have time,
I found out he been tricking, so I'm about mine.
So I'm riding around in that beamer, drop top two seata,
He ain't care about me, so I ain't stressing him either.
Police and them diamonds got them bitches shining,
Had the whole club watching and I wasn't even trying.
Bunch of bad bitches rocking, money in the pockets,
You can hate it, you can love it, but I bet that you won't stop it.
Name is not an option, we always get it popping,
When you're bad and you're bossy, you always get on top.

Got 'em yellin
Pretty red, I don't need your money, nigga, give me head,
Swag on a million, come prepared,
Good life, glam life, living it.

Ain't on nothing petty, I'm in my zone,
Ain't on nothing petty, I'm in my zone,
Ain't on nothing petty, I'm in my zone,
Ain't on nothing petty, I'm on Patrone
And I'm feeling it.
Pretty red, I don't need your money, nigga, give me head,
Swag on a million, come prepared,
Good life, glam life, living it.
Ain't on nothing petty.

I just made it rain, I'm sober, never lame,
Fuck the other side, they're so irrelevant,
Teach you hoes a thing or two about elegance,
You don't fit my standards, up your measurements.
Team Louis Vuitton, I'm stepping in, she basic and I'm excellence,
Work hard, but I make it look effortless,
And that top spot is my residence.
Murder everything and then leave no evidence, them rock stars I represent,
Jumped off and been running it forever since,
Got hits, baby, check my record list.
My bank role is indefinite, the main I ain't got no limit,
My diamonds is so expensive, and I keep'em custom fitted.
I'm a always go and get it, it ain't nothing about me timid,
See I told 'em I'm a make it, and they live it, 'cause I did it.

Got'em yellin
Pretty red, I don't need your money, nigga, give me head,
Swag on a million, come prepared,
Good life, glam life, living it.

Ain't on nothing petty, I'm in my zone,
Ain't on nothing petty, I'm in my zone,
Ain't on nothing petty, I'm in my zone,
Ain't on nothing petty, I'm on Patrone
And I'm feeling it.
Pretty red, I don't need your money, nigga, give me head,
Swag on a million, come prepared,
Good life, glam life, living it.
Ain't on nothing petty.

I'm turned up and I'm going in, the NB, I feel it rolling in.
They want my spot, ain't no controlling them,
You just a flop, you wasn't born to win.
Play your role, background, I got the heat, I told her back down.
I keep it a hunnid, don't bring your act around,
'Cause I'm from the streets, I ain't talking rap now.
I just wanna rock, I'm feeling it, I've seen the stage, I'm killing it.
I'm on that piece of rock, I'm feeling it, glam life, we're living it.

Pretty red, I don't need your money, nigga, give me head,
Swag on a million, come prepared
Good life, glam life, living it.

Ain't on nothing petty, I'm in my zone,
Ain't on nothing petty, I'm in my zone,
Ain't on nothing petty, I'm in my zone,
Ain't on nothing petty, I'm on Patrone
And I'm feeling it.
Pretty red, I don't need your money, nigga, give me head,
Swag on a million, come prepapred
Good life, glam life, living it.
Ain't on nothing petty.
