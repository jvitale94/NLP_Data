

I'm here now you old news
Gotta couple porshe trucks, couple old schools
I'll line ya ass up push ya tape backwards
Cuz ima real nigga I don't like rappers
And that ain't this and this ain't that
And bitch I'm strapped
Fuck wit real niggaz that'll cut ya throat
And they don't drink Pepsi they just sell Coke
All I do is talk blow it's like my brain on drugs
See me out nigga I do my thang in clubs
Listen up Jeezy gotta a little riddle
Stack of 20-dollar bill two bands in the middle


All the gangstas they gon ride to this
They gon grind to this
They gon shine to this
This is gangsta music, this is gangsta music, this is gangsta music, and
this is gangsta music
All the hustlers they gon ride to this
They gon grind to this
They gon shine to this
This is hustler music, this is hustler music, this is hustler music, and
this is hustler music

We don't talk on the phone cuz it might stick
Gotta play for the 7 call it Mike Vick
Dirty birds nigga we play wit dem falcons
Know some niggaz in the Decatur that pay for dem falcons
Talking young hungry niggaz eat ya whole plate
Jeezy place the order niggaz eat ya whole face
You got me misconstrued all fucked up
Jump out hit the switch light ya ass up
Carbon 15 wit the hundred round drum
Got plenty for any nigga think he wants some
We don't leave 'em at the house we bring 'em out
My chain for yo life we can swap it out



The hoes love my voice
Make they pussy moist
Certified g shit and I'm the gangsta's choice
Niggaz popping off hope they bullet proof
Leave holes in ya tha size of a sunroof
Mack 11 in the club and a snub nose
Swear to God knock you niggaz out ya fuckin' clothes
Lay ya ass flat like a doormat
Niggaz ask for it but they don't want that
In the rap game takin niggaz clientele
White ones like the powder that I used to sell
Give a fuck about a playa hater
Hit 'em wit the tool flush his whole radiator
