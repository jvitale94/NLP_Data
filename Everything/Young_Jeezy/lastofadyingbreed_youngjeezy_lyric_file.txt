Only hang out wit dem criminals and dem drug dealers (ayyy)
I'm from even where da dead die (die)
But try an do it big like da kid from bedstuy
I see death around da corna and I ain't scared I got a carbon wit 15 and I'm fully prepared (that's right)
Lord a mercy 20 rounds in a clip (jea)
Outta line get 20 rounds in ya hip (ayyy)
Shoot first and ask question lata (lata)
Da answer is it was all about da paper (jea)
Everything da game is shit to lose and a new forty-five that I'm dying to use (yeahhhh)



If ya real like me (like me)
Throw ya hoods in da air so da whole wide world can see (ay)
Last of a dying breed, Last of a dying breed, Last of a dying breed
And if ya real like me (like me)
Keep that thang on ya hip that's just da way that its gotta be
Last of a dying breed, Last of a dying breed,last of a dying breed
Young Buck
I done seen niggas come and go
Shit da whole world done seen what I done before
We do anythang when da funds is low
I'm da reason outta townas don't come no mo
Let me show you niggas how to break down da whole thang
My nigga B.G. know Buck been a birdman
Its got to be in ya blood to be a thug
If I ain't making enough I ma jack my plug
We was born in it
Not sworn in it
You can go against it or you can join wit it
Made mark so da streets gon remember me
Now come and git it nigga Ca$hville Tennekee holla back



Some of da dudes we thought was real O.G.s was O.D.s cause they talk pleas and including G's like you and me (you and me)
The first step was going to set a trap
So in a short period they convince da grand jury to allow a phone tap
And if they listen in
Not once did they hear us mentioning
Murder and a cocaine distributing
Through all that was dividends coming in
I'm straightly getting betta yet we too smart for ya bullshit
Calling all cars (calling all cars)
Hit your burglar alarms and tell 'em hurry up and come dem niggas got guns
Man down shots fired only fuck niggas and cops died
First stage of a ride and dem fuck couldn't sneak by
When you a witnessing and shit five bitch be quiet because they only got what you tell em
And then da witness that they had to ?? was lying there dead
Shot in da street all red
Wit two shots to his head
Cause he was working for da feds
And they last informant informed us they had it out for us
For a bird but he got popped for it
So ride or die for em (ride or die for em)
Betta yet you betta kill em
Cause I think he gon get da bitch to tell em
And he probably done all ready told
But then again with out a witness dem bitches ain't got shit
