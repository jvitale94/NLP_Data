Gon head nigga act silly, Let the choppa  Wet Willies
We cooking chickens in the back, like we at Chili's
All my niggas still up in there, Fuck you gon Free Willy
I bought my gold for the gold diggers
Learned about the whip game from the old niggas
They like why they call him Snow? Cause he cold nigga
Singin' Yayo songs... J. Cole nigga OK
Two bricks in one car
Bout to get 'em butt naked like a porn star
You know I put 'em back together like a mixtape
Have 'em jumpin' off the shelf like a sextape
If it jumpin' back right, then the sex great
Two , got 'em looking like a pancake
Half a million dollar play with a handshake
 til your hand ache OK

All good, need a ace band
And buy 4s all day he the eight man
You really gettin that cake, then you the cake man
You really whippin' them pies, you the bake man

They say great minds think alike. Know what I'm thinkin?
A great grind will change your life

You know we peeled the top back like a T top
Watch the money starting coming, hit the G spot OK
This is something you should understand
When the work drop, same color rubber band
For my ghetto superstar, that really got fans
Let it sit up on the counter, catch a damn tan OK
Stove on and the water running
The yayo told the soda, look the water coming
It's gonna be a lil cool, be prepared
Nigga whatever you do, don't be scared!
