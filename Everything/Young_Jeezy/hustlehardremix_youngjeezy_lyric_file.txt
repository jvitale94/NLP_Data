

Young jumped on that G-Mix
100 like 3 bricks
O's droppin' like bird shit
Young back on that bird shit
Shoes behind me in that Benzo
Young pull up in that Enzo
Red 'Rari got two golds
cost a million, want two more
2 seaters got three hoes
Foreign bitch she got 3 golds
Speakin' of shots, lets take one
20 bands in that take one
Young nigga you crazy
fuck ya doin' lil Haiti
Hundred deep maybe 8o's
All these muthafuckers crazy
Dunkin' blocks what raised me
Pride niggas can't fade me
Whole hood on that blue shit
While I was riding round in that new shit
Hundred grand in my pocket
50 bands in my motor
Dark side of my chauffeur
Sirred off with my toaster
All you see is my tattoos
All you see is my big chains
Right in front of my Versace belt
All you see is that big thang
87 be the logo
Been gettin' ask Polo
Lotta money that hurt shit
Two n a baby, that bird shit
Momma calls, she want a new place
Homeboy just caught a new case
Need rooms just bought a new safe
Audemar just got a new face
Blowin' that Obama
Ridin' round with that Llama
Solid gold's my Uzi
Free my nigga Lil Boosie 'cause it's

Same old shit, just a different day
Out here tryna get it, each and every way
Homies need some blocks
Coupes need some shoes
Used to get it soft, this what I'mma do
Hustle, hustle, hustle hard
Hustle, hustle, hustle hard
Hustle, hustle, hustle hard
Hustle, hustle, hustle hard
