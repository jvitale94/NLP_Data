Wassup
Count money, get money, count money


I used to have nothing
But now I got a whole lot of everythang
And I come through stuntin'
And now the whole world gonna know my name
And I used to have nothing
But now I got a whole lot of everythang
That's why I come through stuntin'
When I'm gone the whole world gonna know my name


12 years old, caught up in that street life
I was tryna shine harder than the street lights
Ran the streets tongue-tied, couldn't sleep nights
Cause when you're living wrong, it's hard to sleep right
But it is what it is, gotta eat right
Cop them things they be whiter than your teeth right?
Drank some big things on my grandmama couch
It's some mink things at my grandmama house
Cuz when you play the game every strike counts
And why they call them 8balls? Cuz they don't bounce
Bag full of weight down in the crack yard
But you can't get 'em out until it's 


I used to have nothing
But now I got a whole lot of everythang
And I come through stuntin'
And now the whole world gonna know my name
And I used to have nothing
But now I got a whole lot of everythang
That's why I come through stuntin'
When I'm gone the whole world gonna know my name


What it do nigga? 1 triple zero
Who you be nigga? Neighborhood hero
Dope game, no shame, nigga more pain
See them enough to drive a young nigga insane
From the windows of the trap, see the prison bars
Flashing lights on top, we call them prison cars
For my niggas make a livin' on they mobile phone
Grind hard till your earrings cost a mobile home
Ain't nothing wrong with that, get your mobile on
Get the bricks butt naked, get your troubles on
All the other bullshit I could have focused on
Said fuck that shit and kept my focus on


I used to have nothing
But now I got a whole lot of everythang
And I come through stuntin'
And now the whole world gonna know my name
And I used to have nothing
But now I got a whole lot of everythang
That's why I come through stuntin'
When I'm gone the whole world gonna know my name


Yeah they try to stop a nigga but I won't let 'em
See the wheels? How the fuck you ain't gon sweat 'em
Bet you one thing, bet you niggas won't bet 'em
G5 take off, you know I'm gon' jet 'em
Road trips ain't shit, you know I go get 'em
Plus my man send his check, you know we gon' split 'em
Now so many shoes that I can't wear
From that real nigga cloth, that's why you can't tell
Always knew that I'd make it out someday
Traffic jam, I was going down the one-way
Twelve used to hit the block, I had to run away
Now this nigga be flyin' in the runway


I used to have nothing
But now I got a whole lot of everythang
And I come through stuntin'
And now the whole world gonna know my name
And I used to have nothing
But now I got a whole lot of everythang
That's why I come through stuntin'
When I'm gone the whole world gonna know my name
