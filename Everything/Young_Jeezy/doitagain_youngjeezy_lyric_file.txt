You know I grind, straight hustle, hit licks, 
Get em break em down, weigh bricks 
Late night count it up talk shit, 
That why I had to try one for the streets right quick 


Four one two fives two on the counter 
Whats the scene? a triple bean 
Two money counters two fifties dem five hunrdeds 
They in the plastic oil thangs them one thousandths 
They in the attic. 
Yellow shit that have you itchin that instant linchin 
What ya say its too short thats Walter Payton 
Get it right thats fifty six that thirty six 
Twenty eight thats times two thats plenty six 
Fifty six a quarter short thats seven vics 
Residue up in the wrap thats evidence 
Yellow water its hella water thats what it took 
Drop the price its twenty five thats reggie bush 




Do it all again hell yeah you know I would 
I almost lost my life puttin this chrome under the hood 
I damn near lost it all for these cars and these jewels 
The D.A. tried to make the case thick like glue 

Trials, tribulations, you know we heard em boss 
We don't eat beef burgers you know we burnin those 
The microwave will get it done but I prefer the stove 
All black sivich hatch back now I'm on the roll 
Made the play and came back now I gotta fresh sack 
Four hours there four hours back 
Had to get that road cash residue on the stacks we just call it 
Blow cash 
In the streets pickin chins thats better than no cash 




Brickz of white, fields of purple 
I'ma landscaper, construction worker 
Mr. Kool-Aid drinker, pitcher purple 
Mr. he so real, break bread with his circle {yo goootttii} 
Straight thuggin, straight hustling 
White, whole thangs for twenty nothing 
What it do sixteen, seventeen, I'm talkin fish that purest shit you ever seen 
I'm talkin murder first 48 crime scene I'm talkin me the realest nigga {yo goottii} 
You ever seen, in my life is all I know, I cant pretend you lock me up, let me out and I'ma do it again 


And I do it all again
