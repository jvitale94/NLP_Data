Wake up in the morning, who the fuck am I screwing?
My partner on brown and you know I'm on white
You know its going down, I can do this all night
Gotta get to the paper one time for the haters
Money over bitches two times for the fakers
Cause even in the dark, baby I’m a shine bright
I'm way too gone, the best night of my life

Yeah, I said g-g-g-go DJ
I see you got that Jizzle on replay
Just keep that Jizzle on repeat
It's about the time everybody scream "free Meech!"
Let's take ya bitch ass back to '05
Close your eyes, take a rough nigga look, Atlanta lights
Club vision, PJ in my hand, I'm on the couch
Man this nigga Meech just blew a quarter mil, he bought a house
Man you niggas gonna lace up your sneaks, it's time to ball
Presidential at the Swiss Hotel, making come alls.
Posted up, all black in the back, 100 deep
A hundred coupes posted up in the front, 200 seats
Man somebody call the IRS, too many lambos
Yea I'm talking bottles and blunts, all you can handle
Them other niggas fake, to them fallings where its at.
Man the real niggas do real things, let's drink to that!


I'm way to gone, what the fuck I’m a doing
Wake up in the morning, who the fuck am I screwing?
My partner on brown and you know I'm on white
You know its going down, I can do this all night
Gotta get to the paper one time for the haters
Money over bitches two times for the fakers
Cause even in the dark, baby I’m a shine bright
I'm way too gone, the best night of my life

I said I'm gone! I'm going going gone!
Way this night is going, man I won't make it home
I’m a wake up in the room, wake up with a hangover
What I spent last night I could bought a Range Rover
Got my Raybans on, yeah I see you haters
Keep doing what you doing, cause I need you haters
She said whats your cologne, said you can call it strong
If I had to name my money baby, I would call it long.

I said I'm way too gone, I don’t see nobody,
I ain't even on the bill, I'm acting like it’s my party.
Feel like I'm on fire or just that hot,
If I smoke another blunt, yeah I swear I'm gonna die
You can call the weed man, tell him bring another zip
I know he just left, yeah he gotta make another trip
So hot in here feel like I'm going to faint
Even though I'm past my limit, still think I'm gonna drink




I woke up early this morning,
Three white girls from the Pink Pony,
I'm blowing money fast, so caught up in the moment
One time for the bar, two times for my homies,
I'm a rock star in real life; I'm an astronaut outta sight.
Put Codeine in my Sprite, my wrist is full of ice
I don’t even know her name, she so caught in the hype.
Its ok baby, cuz I'm a millionaire for life,
I got bitches on my payroll, they coming back like white

I'm with Ethiopian, we in Vegas shootin' dice
Got a girl at home, I know I'm wrong, it feels so right
On the first road, young I hope I wrote a sinch
We in the club for thugs, this must be heaven.
