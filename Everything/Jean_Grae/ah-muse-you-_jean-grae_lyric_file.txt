[Intro]
Baby, I’m wondering if you might wanna come over
You know, you inspire me to do beautiful things, say beautiful things
You’re beautiful that way
I was just thinking maybe this weekend, we could be quiet
Well, not really quiet, but just shut the door
Pull the blinds and get inspired, yeah

[Verse]
I got a pillow with your name on it
You down, monograms - so you know you got the claims on it
I sewed it by hand with heart strings
Guitar strings play when you lay on it
I hope you like it, stay on it
You should, play on it, we will
My friends gon’ have to kill me just to get me out the house if you in it
Feel it, fit in the palm of my hand
We could be phenomenal with it
Nine positions a minute
Alright, well, that’s a lot
I’m just excited to be inviting you, delighting you
You like that, glad you do
I hope it rains, imagine you
And me all soaked up in the window panes
I could take a ride you know, you could hold the reins
We could cross the Great Divide together, arrive together
High-five it after, try it again
In the bathtub listening to violins

[Hook]
Baby, you know I admire you
You know that I’ve been trying to
Be inspired, let me use you
Amuse you
Baby, everything you do
I could really get into you
If you let me use you
Amuse you

[Outro]
I like to play fair
I don’t play if we’re not playing fair
I need to get some
Baby, let me get some
Let me get some
Let me get some of your
