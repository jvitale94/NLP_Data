His business is usual
But trap pudical dirt ,that's beautiful
Pass me you'll see wrath spitting at you
A fast furious mad curios man
Slap man sure it ain't one
Slap jaw give an hacksaw lover
Burglar, a bank robber
Bumble his plan, invert his revolver
Tag anonymous man , I'm a brag I promise to
I'ma makes you wish you would've been the human shield for armado
Please , my 16 spit pristine
Like the mouth on a debutant named Christine
Jean ,Hurricane name, unobtained fame fuck it
My son will be the son of a dame who changed the game, fucker

From the basement to the case laceshit
Rap braided me a friendship bracelet
You lose , I'm just a lil warm
My true form will be revealed in a few years
When the phoenix swarms
I'm 3 steps ahead of you, please flex
The medical needs of need next just to breathe jeez god bless
Accomplice none I'm complex son
The confidence of Donald Trump mixed with a convict on the run
Compliments to my mama,
Miss Benjamin school teacher slash singer slash rule preacher
Who bet against her daughter being weaker than her
Praise right, framed like fight back
See these well I'm quite likely to strike back
I ain't easy to stomach I make them quizy from it
See greasy cause a discomfort but yo you see they love it

And I'm not threatening y'all yet,
The call y'all get is late for 'em 2004 bet

Hold up, I sip an xo and then
Scratch out your eyes like I'm playing tic toe with them
Black pride promoting it , but crap's been spoken
The net face of rap only New York niggers get that
Tat reference stash weapons with some brash methods
Till you shitting grass knuckles and your ass puck has passed tension
Her execute her effortless the club in us
Miss construed us ambivalence you imbeciles
High level ground, I'm small but I walk on you heavy George Jefferson, bentley
Eventually you'll get it, potentially a legend
Dispense of me never , they'll mention me forever

You wanna turn the other cheek in disgust
You'll learn Jean Grae to trust , follow the leader
