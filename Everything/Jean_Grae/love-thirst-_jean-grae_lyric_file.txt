(feat. 9th Wonder)

[seconds of deep breaths and whipserings along with "oohs"]

[Jean Grae:]
My caramel mohagony fairy tale
He gon' do very well; I'm fearin for the farewell, stay awhile
We could just lay awhie, see me smile better
Lean your chest on me, make you my sweater - I want the rest of you
Pressin me head-up, I need contact
Your windows reflectin me back, later I ask where your memories at
Your face tellin me that, you need a taste
Where the Hennessey's at? C'mon, blace me
Replace the glasses with the tip of my tongue
I won't front baby, lady is sprung
And though relation is young, I feel us makin a connection beyond
So that I {ssssss! } like a chick in a saun', no lie, won't I
Take my time, let the bass unwind
Claymation couldn't mold a better mind, you're sick (sick)
And I'll be the nurse and you be the patient
Boy, how insane could it get? You so hot, baby...

[Chorus:]
Hiiiiiiiiiiiiigh (you're makin me so...)
Hiiiiiiiiiiiiigh (you're gettin me so...)
Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiigh...
... c'mon
Hiiiiiiiiiiiiigh (you're makin me so...)
Hiiiiiiiiiiiiigh, baby I'm
So high off, your love, ooh, ooh, oooh...

[Jean Grae:]
Okay, turn the lights out - no, turn 'em back on
Want you to see my backbone and my black tone
Start minimal, raise it to animal, please
You're no amateur, please me I'm tangable
Knees be all tangled up, like the handles
Placed on the mantle, that romantic angles
We'll slow dance 'til tango and gets horizontal
I know you go longer that flow with no comma (hehe)
I'm high on ya, ya like it don't cha?
Could survive, but it's bitin on ya
Like those, high notes, nibble just a little bit
Everything I'm thinkin, you're already deliverin it
Quiver, pleasure unheard, you ain't even done first, baby
When I done burst, crazy
I'm in love thirst, you are the quencher
Maybe we should be taping so you can remember... I'm just sayin!

[Chorus x2]

[giggles]
Hiiiigh...
Uh, uh, huh-uh...
You're makin me so...
[giggles again]
Oh, erhm... Stop!
You're makin me so - hiiiiiigh
I'm gettin so - hiiiiiigh
Baby - high off... [giggles]
[Jean Grae speaks in foreign language]
Why not? [giggles]
[Moans] Stop... okay...
Don't stop... [exhales softly]
[Soft moans] [Giggles]
It's loud... c'mon...
Uhh... [moans three times]
Eheh, not there... not there...
[Moans four times in rhythm, each becoming louder]
Ooh... oh baby, don't do that...
Don't do that... [moans and giggles again]
[Loud moan, perhaps reaching climax]

[9th Wonder quietly heard on feedback mic]
Need some tissue?

[Jean Grae:]
Naw, I'm good, nigga!
[cracks up]
