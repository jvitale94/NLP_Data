About wanting to have a conversation about clarification because you need clarification but then also feeling weird about being the person to initiate the "WHAT ARE WE DOING" conversation. Sucks. No one wants to be that person.
lyrics
Make me wanna sa-- 

Sometimes, time don't let shit be done. 
Sometimes, your mind won't let shit go. 
Even if it's what you want, we know... 

hearts don't give a good gatdamn, what you want. 

What do you need from me? 
Feels like the right thing to ask while we're here at the top of the road. 
But, I don't know. 
I don't know. 
Rather say: 

Nothing 
Nothing 
Nothing 

Shit. 
I was doing fine spending time getting fucked up, 
finding my peace.... 

alone. 

Guess it's never gonna be a good time, 
cause time don't give a good gatdamn what you want. 
What do you need from me? 
Feels like a good time to ask since we're here at the top of the road. 
But I don't know. 
Man, I don't know. 
I'd rather say: 

Nothing 
Nothing 
Nothing 

Saying it won't is only making it worse, 
I need to control it. 
Nothing goes bad. 
Put it away 

(and it goes down) 

Saying it won't is only making it worse, 
I need to control it. 
Nothing goes bad. 
Put it away. 

and it goes down 
and it goes down 
and it goes down
