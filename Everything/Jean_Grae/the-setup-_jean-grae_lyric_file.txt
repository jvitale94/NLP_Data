(Verse 1)
85 or 95 practice shit from 94
Pimpin to it or decouring it
Fuzzy dice plus we nice and my people cousin in the back seat
With the customize breaking duchess with the butter knife
We bustin' in the club like we bust his gang
Bust a gang of dudes looking at us like we was topanga
Boy meets world, animate it like manga
Boy meets girl, I caught his eyelids if he threw his retina
Dressed out regular, smile then begging ya
Kicked it like we power spice and David Beckham bend ya
Mend around the conversation I could get into you
Said his pop's from India , mom was dominican
First generation though , grandma new guinean
Brought a tranny girl with in the club with them but then again
She acted like a chicken dancing dirty around the penny man
Henny in 'em , fendy on 'em they spending on buying them drinks
I said they only know they coming on to work late that they'll be cumming on her
He's loving the persona they started playing 80's Madonna
Now I don't give a fuck about this club
For the white girl 2 steps the borderline of burning up
Turning a charm now, putting his arm around
Calm down dancing slower too the boss now

Love me in a special way
What more can I say
Please love me

(Verse 2)
He whisper that he gotta escalate out front
I wanna be out but chill pour sip my getting style fo' real
I might think about it, think about it
And for the first time , peep his neck gliding like he gotta brink about it
This shit don't match up , I backed up
Looking at his tims they jacked up
Like something ol' stacker
Said I must endure to the rest room I'll return soon
Motion to my people let's move
So guess who stepped up blocking my path
Chest all buffed up rocking a glass , back and forth
Neck moving like she doing the snake
A vet name shifting like she boosting the bricks but hold up
Come and just freak her the fuck out
And if she don't stop man she gonna get snuffed out
I don't use the word usually bitch fine
It's brutally honest that I'm using it at this time
Now I'm standing with my hand in the athmos pose
Perfectly still, smirking my brill
She thinks I'm by myself but I will murder death
Kill her if she touches me, visions of this whole club brushing me
My home girl stand back ready to thong
Nigga staying at the back of her like that's the one, aww shit
This whole party was a setup, I should've known
You should've known, we should've known better
She got her crew back and erupt shit
Attracting the public, enchanting like they rapping on dumb shit
I look to the right to the bar, saw my homie
Standing with the bottle tucking it with the scarf
She caught my eye ,I nodded quick
I lean back right fist, uppercut her on the trinny bitch
And duck down like I was running with black moon
Saw the molotov fly by we evacuated the back room
Oh Lord , we race across the parking lot
Post mortum but living don't know what shorty got
Heart beating now we in the car speeding
Tip and quiet till my people's like
Yo , I think I'm bleeding

(Outro)
Fucking with dudes who get setup
And dudes know it hikes you should date her
But fuck all that wild shit just pass me the liquor
Fucking with dudes who get setup
Some niggers know while shorty man you should date her
But fuck all that wild shit just pass me the liquor
