Waste no time to get the conversation
Man I'm hardly patient like minorities place tin
An ENR on the wait list, horribly blight
Like I'm modern RnB I guess seen y'all already made
Lip spit game quicker, got no time I can play with
I'm a Rick James nigga give it to me don't say shit
Can truly be basement, red light
I might not make a move and be faithful
If you move with me graceful
Have you move in to grace call if you're not in the mood
And when we root to get grave skull
If you don't catch it too 'cause I'm refunding the face full
You get canned up great updated like facebook
Forget man's plans now hey look your spaceship
'Cause Ali, Michael J. Fox ,Tone wap and other infamous from mobs raps
Jean poppin' shit alot , not
'Cause everytime you with the clean you dream of rocks
Bean cop full deranged
Ring finger picture lingering your brain
Bring liquor with you if you wish to game , point
Not score maybe I'll get my rocks off
And you can get lock jaw but Don no sleep I'm a rock star
Minus the coke, even if the finest still note
I get my high on legally ,frequently
Holy lie to dope require frequency
Don't you wish you could kiss her up sticks you would
When I kick up a scene cougar
Spit so good,
Frenzy wanna ask me hit get on me backstage
Wishing that your speech had a backspace
Friends are like , you mad gay son you fucked a bad lady
If I had the floor, I would've motherfucking bad grade
I thought I told you that miss Genie was the anti ghost face
Not music I don't fuck fans new place
Here's a little woo too, for all you boys out there
You don't choose me , I choose you
I know ye
