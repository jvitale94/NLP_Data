(Intro)
Left foot on, right foot on
You gotta climb
You gotta climb
Left foot on, right foot on
You gotta climb

(Verse)
On my footstep taking I was shaky on the ground
But I left a footprint that was so deep
That when the serpent king came I got ready of fame
'Cause everybody knew me as the heavy foot queen
Third step heard a rep that the girl stomp hard
God damn, godzilla like you got a feela right
Shaking the soul until the six gotta step it
I reckon it was all like wrecking balls
Door smash in, hot floor starts cracking the floor
Act 5, I was there around the neighborhood
On the news live fucking up your cable good
Every station I'm on makes gray and uncon
Buckle up the straps on my mary jane I'm gone
2 2 2to be exact mean the straps hold the sixth step pavement crack
Well my fruit was even late I create a crater
So wild that it set waver tider
So I had to learn to levitate big shiva
If earth can't hold up my weight then I'll leave her

Slickers ain't amazing when they catch you with an up skirt
Grabbing my dress an effin lesson to eleven
Birding on the twelve, I'm up in the heavens
Drop a nation at the superstition of 13
Revelation in my mind said I could bird free
But first of all the force stork the stall cause
And I ain't stop counting
