(Verse)
Geenie touch a mean girl, geenie advance from them
Beating up your team leave you bleeding your man's a man
It's really no competing , no receiving ,no answer then
Keep your motherfucking green, no gambling
Bumbling your mumbling your word just cancel them
'Cause no one cares for them and no one asks for them
And you ain't masculine and I ain't masculine
But then again I'm feminine it comes with a validage
Deep bruise maybe conceal it
But some of these clues , blubur and did it
I wanna beat you, I'm getting in it
I rather be two girls with a cup
A couple of peeps to fuck with nothing but love
A couple of freaks to fuck ya nothing but love
A couple of geeks to fuck ya nothing but love
And in a couple of weeks they'll be a couple of thugs

(Hook)
See that's me when I walk up in the place yes
Double fist drink doing a two style
And everybody know it's gonna fuck with me come on ,that's me
And that's you when you walk up in the place ,nah
Everybody wishing that you would've stayed home
I don't even think you know
That that's you homie, ye that's me
You hear that?
That's me
They so happy to see me
And that's you , ouch
That's you
Then me

(Verse)
Mercenary amazing
On everybody's most hated and favorite list
They curse you when they curse up black mary made the list
I reverse to learn shit, learn the words of them saying the shit
Or you can raise your wrist and praise the ways of your wrist failing
You'll just gain a couple of permanent braces
Saying they should've been murder cool
Saying let me murder you
I'm here for the community and numerals for you
I'm for the people quite like a kegal
Exorcise done but prostitute's illegal
I stay with a crown , I salute you stay down
Stay the greatest now, stay out of kick town

(Hook)
See that's me when I walk up in the place yes
Double fist drink doing a two style
And everybody know it's gonna fuck with me come on ,that's me
And that's you when you walk up in the place ,nah
Everybody wishing that you would've stayed home
I don't even think you know
That that's you homie, ye that's me
You hear that?
That's me
That's me
And that's you , ouch
That's you
Then me
