Nigga, dirty money


Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


Dirty, fo sho
It's your downfall


Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


Hopeless again, and the more I stick around the shit get more fucked up
That's why I'm back on Holloway gettin' fucked up
Thinkin' back on how it used to be when it was all good
We wasn't trippin', this was our hood
I had your motherfuckin back
And when it was time to go to war, it was like "where these niggaz at?"
Fuck rackets, we ain't never been the type to hold out
Or, let a motherfucker show out
No doubt, we put it down for the 9-0-triple 4
Droppin tops, fuckin fine hoes
These other niggaz is finally catching up
Listening to rappers ballin and gettin touched
Wasup? You done forgot about the street rules, splurgin
Is you a motherfucking fool?
Money ain't a thing to a nigga out here rappin
But to a nigga out there cappin?
That's they downfall
