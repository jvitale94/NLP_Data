In the middle of the show.
I had to go, I had to see her, see her.
I must be nuts, that's what they asked me
I may be but oh I need her, need her.

I need her yeah, she got my air
And I'm running, I'm running low.
Where'd my driver go? Men I don't care.
I got the keys, so I'm driving alone uh.

And try to be ready when I get there
In front of your door, oh baby get in.
I'm ready to breathe in that good air
I'm dropping the top, I'm lettin' it in

Ohhh ohh ohh... ohh ohh...
Got the keys so we're gone uh


I'm burning out, I'm showing off.
My heartbeat loud as my sixers, sixers.
Guys pull me over and then they ask me
If I know I'm breaking the law.

I said yeah she got my air
And I'm running, I'm running low.
Where'd my driver go? Men I don't care
I got the keys, so I'm driving alone uh.

And try to be ready when I get there
In front of your door, oh baby get in.
I'm ready to breathe in that good air
I'm dropping the top, I'm lettin' it in

Ohhh ohh ohh... ohh ohh...
Got the keys so we're gone uh


On my way, I'm coming
Stick shift won't get in the groove but I'm coming
Traffic killing me, barely can groove but I coming... yeah I'm coming
Phone dead can't talk to you right now
But I'm coming to get you, coming...
I'm coming to get you, coming...
I'm rushing cause I'm missing my boo, my my baby...
You got what I what I, I, need... oh my baby...

And try to be ready when I get there
In front of your door, oh baby get in.
I'm ready to breathe in that good air
I'm dropping the top, I'm lettin' it in

Ohhh ohh ohh... ohh ohh...
Got the keys so we're gone uh
