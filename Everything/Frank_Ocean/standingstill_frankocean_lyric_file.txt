I'm standing by your locker in the hallway after class
Swear I'm amazed
The drawing in my binder every picture I put a halo on your head
Yeahhhhhhh!


I'm on waitin on my angel, my first love
My first kiss - my second, my third
The one my mommma, like so much
I'm standin, still for, ya waitin
I'm standin, still 'til, you in there
As the time flies faster baby
You could fly, fly, faster baby
I'm standin - standin still
I'm standin still, standin still
Oh, standin still


Saturdays I'm at the snow cone spot
Tryin to guess your favorite flavor
I'm thinkin... cotton candy maybe
I'm fallin and I placed it on the table next to me
I wish you could taste it
Cause it's slowly melting




While the rain storm takes over, outrageous baby
I'll be standing here
Seconds forward, or decades later
I'll be right there
Oh no matter what
I'll be here - however long




I'm standin still, standin still
Ohh standin still
