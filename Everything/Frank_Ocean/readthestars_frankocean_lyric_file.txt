If I just took what I've been given
They say I never know what to do
Unless I'm told
I feel underestimated, So unaccounted for
Then you want to call me to your office right after school
And tell me your version of my future


But let's take all the frames off the walls
I wanna see one diploma that says "you can read the stars"
Don't talk me out of it
Don't talk me out of it
It's my life, Don't talk me out of my life
It's my life

I used to put an apple on Ms. Jacob's desk,
But she never liked me
She said I'm gon' fail, no matter what I give
She said 'cause my skin wasn't light enough
Tuition  wasn't high enough
I couldn't understand just what I did.
So underestimated, You left me unaccounted for
Now you want to me your version of my future. 


But let's take all the frames off the walls
I wanna see one diploma that says "you can read the stars"
Don't talk me out of it
Don't talk me out of it
It's my life, Don't talk me out of my life

It's my life

Just tell me how
You're much better than me now
You tore me down till there was nothing left
Look at me, Look at me, Look at me, Look at me,
I'm still standing
Look at me
Look at me now, Look me in my eyes


But let's take all the frames off the walls
I wanna see one diploma that says "you can read the stars"
Don't talk me out of it
Don't talk me out of it
It's my life, Don't talk me out of my life

It's my life
It's my life
It's my life
