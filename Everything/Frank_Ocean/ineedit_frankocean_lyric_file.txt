One winter morning I went for a drive
I stopped somewhere between June and July
I love these warmer days
But maybe I can't see that the snow's still falling
I only see the gift my heart just brought me
Merry Christmas babe... that's what she said
Oh she didn't have to do much, but she made me smile
December in Manhattan feels like South Beach now
I love my bab-y, oh yes I do


It ain't about you givin anything, as long as you're my everything
Cause lady what could you give to me better than what you've been givin me
Just keep talkin in my ear, cause I need it
And tell me you'll be right here, if I need ya
Cause the greatest present you could give is the present
Ohhh, I need it

It's just a regular morning, I'm a regular guy
Takin the train to my nine to nine
But something's different today, hey
I had an envelope sittin right next to my breakfast
And it's from my baby, not the bill collectors
Happy birthday bay-bay... then it sai
I know we don't got much but baby we got us
And after you get off, we gon make sweet love
Now go and get that cake - ohhh yeah



One day the whole world will hear me sing
Then I'ma run and buy you those things
But right now, three months pay barely gets me a diamond baby
But one day I'ma buy you that ring, ohhhhhh
Just keep talkin in my ear, cause I need it
And tell me you'll be right there, if I need ya
Cause the greatest present you could give is the present
Ohhh, I need it


Ohhhh, ohhhh
Nothing but, everything
Ohh yeah yeah
I don't need anything
Long as you're my everything
Long as you're my everything
Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh
Yeah yeah, yeah
