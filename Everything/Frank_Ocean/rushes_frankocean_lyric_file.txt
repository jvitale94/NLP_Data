

Gonna be somebody, oh I follow
Oh and it's so cloudy
Running showers and the mist so fly
Enough time to know, nothing at all
Oh I see the lines, there's two lines
You'll live a life anew
Tell me what you need from me? Gas money?
And I did what I needed to, to be guided
You cut your teeth on sheets in Paris
Hope the water's deep enough
(Rushes to the head)
We've been here before
The first time is not the best time
I ain't felt this way in years
First I was rushing full weight
This time I'm waiting for the rush
(Help me up,..)
Infatuation's your rush
(Help me up, help me, help me up, help me up yeah...
Do you...)
Keep pushing on 'em, never let 'em stop
 what happens to be, what happens to me, upon his feet
Twin peaking, highs and lows, we shaded off in 
Bygones we wasted here, riding in my two wheels
I love the way you make me feel
(What happens to me)
Me, you and, you and me
(Yeah, just you and me)
( are up on my feet)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I be on 
I'll wake up in a week
Wake me up in a week
It don't matter
It don't matter  pipe it down
It was a crowd, quieting down
I won't sit still, I won't sit still
Friday, gone too late
It's going against your head
I'm getting used to it
Yeah you're going to get used to it
I love the way you make me feel
