I mean, it's cool... want some more?

I built us a little gingerbread house
You said you loved it, I baked you a little
Gingerbread Benz, and you said you dug it
I make stacks and stacks of cake in the bank, bank
You ate through em, you ate through em
You ate through em, yeah, yeah

Tell me how does that taste
Tell me how does that taste, oh
When I re-up, got you coming back
When I'm running out, you keep your bags packed
All the newest shit, and the Benz I baked you
Tell me something baby, baby, I can't blame you
When we first met, I know you told me that your taste was crazy
But sweetie, you tell me now that you're craving
Said that Gucci taste good, but Dior taste amazing, baby

We took chartered flights
All around to taste those malls that
You like most, said the jetfuel taste like pink raspberry
Good credit, A1, just like that sauce
Said you liked Ruth Chris way better
Lean back my seat, watch your head go down

Tell me how does that taste
Tell me how does that taste, oh
When I re-up, got you coming back
When I'm running out, you keep your bags packed
All the newest shit, and the Benz I baked you
Tell me something baby, baby, I can't blame you
When we first met, I know you told me that your taste was crazy
But sweetie, you tell me now that you're craving
Said that Gucci taste good, but Dior taste amazing, baby
Said that Gucci taste good, but Dior taste amazing

I know that you're going to
Love me as long as you're fed, you said
But I like you around
Just want to keep you here
I got to know girl, I ain't running out
I ain't running out

Baby, I can't blame you
When we first met, I know you told me that your taste was crazy
But sweetie, you tell me now that you're craving
Said that Gucci taste good, but Dior taste amazing, baby
Said that Gucci taste good, but Dior taste amazing

Hey baby, I've noticed you eat your jewelry for break
Hey baby, noticed you eat your jewelry for break
Hey baby, noticed you eat your jewelry for breakfast
I swear, it's crazy
