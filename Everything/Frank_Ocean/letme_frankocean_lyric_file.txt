

I don't know if I ever told you this before, before
But you're the only one I ever waited for, this long
And I know the room is crowded
Right now right now
So tell me are you about it
Right now right now

Baby I been thinking of you all the time
As dirty as dishes but would you
Let me let me let me tonight, tonight
See I been dreaming of you in the daytime, and it ain't right
So could you let me let me let me tonight, tonight

Got all them bubbles floating on your pots and pans
From all these bottles of this bottle service babe
Long as the dj's playing all these raunchy songs
Girl we can do this on the dance floor all night long, night long

Now I know the room is crowded
Right now right now
So tell me are you about it
Right now right now

Baby I been thinking of you all the time
As dirty as dishes but would you
Let me let me let me tonight, tonight
See I been dreaming of you in the daytime, and it ain't right
So could you let me let me let me tonight, tonight

Now listen don't you get this twisted girl
And if I leave here without you I'll miss you girl
And if I had you right now, that wouldn't change a thing
You tell me this ain't what you're used to but baby
Can't no man judge you
I can tell ain't no man loving you girl
I can tell ain't no man loving you

Baby I been thinking of you all the time
As dirty as dishes but would you
Let me let me let me tonight, tonight
See I been dreaming of you in the daytime, and it ain't right
So could you let me let me let me tonight, tonight
