

A good pair of dark blues
Hand washed by me, by you
We care enough to
Never let them drag, never let them tear

We've kept the tags on them so we could remember
Exactly what it cost us to get here, to get this pair, (aah)
To get here, to get this pair of ours

Got a love like denim (got a love like denim)
Got a love like denim (got a love like denim)
Got a love like denim (got a love like denim)
Got a love like, got a love like that
A love that lasts, a love that lasts
A love that lasts, a love that we can wear
Got a love like denim

Good jeans, with good care
A lifetime of good fade and good wear
And what we have here with this
Is cut from the same cloth, cut from the same cloth

We've kept the tags on them so we could remember
Exactly what it cost us to get here, to get this pair, (aah)
To get here, to get this pair of ours

Got a love like denim (got a love like denim)
Got a love like denim (got a love like denim)
Got a love like denim (got a love like denim)
Got a love like, got a love like that
A love that lasts, a love that lasts
A love that lasts, a love that we can wear
Got a love like denim

Come on, put your hand in my back pocket, let's walk
Out here, yeah
And let the weather, weather us
And never mind the sun
And never mind the faded
Cause we're strong and we look good in denim

Got a love like denim (got a love like denim)
Got a love like denim (got a love like denim)
Got a love like denim (got a love like denim)
Got a love like, got a love like that
A love that lasts, a love that lasts
A love that lasts, a love that we can wear
Got a love like denim
