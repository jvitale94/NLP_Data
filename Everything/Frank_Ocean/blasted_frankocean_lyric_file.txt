

She's the prettiest girl I've ever seen on a skateboard 
And I'm just a guy with a couple of open ears for her 
She told me every story behind all of her tattoos 
She's thinking maybe the next one, 
Should have something to do with you, 
To do with me... 

Ohh oohhh... ohhh okay well you gotta do mine in color... 
Ohh oohhh... ohhh... Cause all of your exes are in black and white... 

You wanna get blasted, yeah 
Cause you know this love is gonna last, 
And now we getting blasted... uhh... 
Cause I couldn't let you do it by yourself... 
My feelings go deeper than the ink, 
It goes deeper, deep in to your soul 
She said you should get a rubix cube over your heart ohhh yeah 
But you say I've already figured it out, 
Already figured out the love... 
She want me to get a spaceship tatted inside of my lip oohhh ohh... 
Cause that's what she feel like she on when we, 
On each other, 
Loving on each other, 
Kissing on each other. 

Ohh oohhh... ohhh okay well you gotta do mine in color... 
Ohh oohhh... ohhh... Cause all of your exes are in black and white... 

You wanna get blasted, yeah 
Cause you know this love is gonna last, 
And now we getting blasted... uhh... 
Cause I couldn't let you do it by yourself... 

My feelings go deeper than the ink, 
It goes deeper, deep in... to your soul... 

Paper to pen, Needle to skin 
I'm in the chair, and she's over there... 
Taking these pictures and blowing me kisses 
When I ask her to hold my hand, 
She told me to take that ink like man 
Told me take that ink like a man 
She told me that (yeah) 

You wanna get blasted, (blasted) 
Cause you know this love is gonna last, 
And now we getting blasted (blasted) 
Cause I couldn't let you do it by yourself... 
My feelings go deeper than the ink, 
It goes deeper, deep into your soul... 

You know it.
