Turn the page and help me understand
Maybe, I've fallen in love again
If I know how the story ends
Her song has me
Looking for traces of my melody


And I'm, slowly humming, singing the simple phrase
And not another she can deny
Caught in the soundwaves
She can feel my every love
Yes I'm falling, but can't seem to find the words
For her, yeah


So in love, ohh in love
Ohh in love, ohh in love
I want to be, the song she loves
And I never thought I'd say this baby


Found a way to whisper it
Everything I wanted her to hear
Said I would catch her every tear
Hold her through the many years
So long I've been looking
For chances for this heart in me


Now I know that she's the lyric and the tune
That explains the meaning of life
There is no music
Without her to give it to me
Yes I'm falling, but can't seem to find the words
For her, yeah


So in love, ohh in love
Ohh in love, ohh in love
I want to be, the song she loves
And I never thought I'd say this baby

So in love, ohh in love
Ohh in love, ohh in love
I want to be, the one she loves
And I'm hoping that she claims me

Ohh in love....
