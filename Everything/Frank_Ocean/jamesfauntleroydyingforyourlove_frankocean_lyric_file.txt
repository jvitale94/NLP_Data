

Do u remember
That october night
That's when?
I almost lost my life
Found myself being a hero
Trying to guide your heart
No matter how hard I fought
Was over before it started

I thought that we were
Always inside of the battle
I'm on the front line of disaster now
All makes sense I've
Put it together
Guess what we have doesn't matter

Got me dying every night
Just because
Got me fighting every night
To prove my love
We Never get enough
Of fighting in the club
I'm dying for your love
I don't know what u want
You got me fighting every night
To prove my love

All I ever did was
Just try to play my part
Try to be the man
Who would not let u be taken advantage of
But u let it go on
And everytime I see you when I'm out
I wanna crack his dome
Now tell me that I'm wrong

But I thought we were
Always inside of the battle
I'm on the front line of disaster now
All makes sense I've
Put it together
Guess what we have doesn't matter

Got me dying every night
Just because
Got me fighting every night
To prove my love
We Never get enough
Of fighting in the club
I'm dying for your love
I don't know what u want
You got me fighting every night
To prove my love

You got me dying
Fighting every night
Dying
Fighting every night
You have me dying every night
Just because
You got me fighting every night
To prove my love
We Never get enough
Of fighting in the club
I'm dying for your love
I don't know what u want
You got me fighting every night
To prove my love

Always inside of the battle
