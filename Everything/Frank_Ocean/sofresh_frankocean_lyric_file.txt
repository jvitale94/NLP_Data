Ooooh yeah 
So fresh (so fresh) oh yes
And I, know I was in love with you
First time that I met you, butter-flies
Kept me floating in the air, that's how it felt
First word that I spoke it, made you, smile
Cause I got a little style goin
You laugh in my face but, I didn't care
Cause it started the conversation
That led to our first date, now
Old folks used to tell me, I know it and I felt
I know it's true if, they're, just like you

So fresh 
Each time when I closed my eyes
Fade in and your lips touch mine, ooh
So fresh 
You're like my favorite 
I swear you could play forever...
