Buying an apartment wit ya.
Greenspan said the rate was good
My pastor says that your faith is major
Best friend said I ought to wife you today
Like jumping over the broom
The white dress and all, yup the rice and all

They said you love that girl,
You need that girl
But don’t you let her go
Not ever, not ever, no
Who goin solo baby
I know, you told em baby
Watch you, you tell em baby
It’s cool, it’s cool

But the lights is gonna be on us
That’s the reason why I kept this love in the dark
Cuz the lights are gonna be on us
Let em know them lights will never turn off
But its cool, cuz this love will keep us cool,
this love will keep us cool,
this love will keep us cool

Your father really likes me
He calls me son
Your brother I think he hates me
But you say thats how you know its right
Your mother invites me to dinner
All of the time
Only thing she’s been grilling is me.

Keep telling her I love that girl
I need that girl
I won’t let her go
Not ever, not ever, no
Who goin solo baby
I know, you told em baby
Watch you, you tell em baby
It’s cool, it’s cool
But the lights is gonna be on us
That’s the reason why I kept this love in the dark
Cuz the lights are gonna be on us
Let em know them lights will never turn off
But the lights is gonna be on us
That’s the reason why I kept this love in the dark
Cuz the lights are gonna be on us
Let em know them lights will never turn off

It’s strobing baby, and they burning baby
But don’t worry baby, just stay close to me
They flashing, it’s like dynamite
This love will keep us about 55 degrees

Don’t mind the lights
Don’t mind the lights
The love is gonna keep us cool
The love is gonna keep us cool

But the lights is gonna be on us
That’s the reason why I kept this love in the dark
Cuz the lights are gonna be on us
Let em know them lights will never turn off
But the lights is gonna be on us
That’s the reason why I kept this love in the dark
Cuz the lights are gonna be on us
Let em know them lights will never turn off

But its cool, cuz this love will keep us cool,
this love will keep us cool,
this love will keep us cool
