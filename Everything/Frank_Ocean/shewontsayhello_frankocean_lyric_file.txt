

You're my best friend
What was cooler than us?
Whole school already knew what it was
Kiddy crushing, puppy loving, you know

Ah
You are my high school Wifey
College made it different
I stayed at home and you didn't
You got a scholarship to Michigan State
Drove my heart 2000 miles away


And now I sit at home, answer the phone missing
Wishing she would call
And say hello, say hello
I'm in the zone?
Readjusting to the fact she's been gone
And I'm alone, I'm alone


Keep playin' the same songs in my car
Hung up cause she ain't on the passenger, the passenger
And I can't even play madden any more
Oh no because I can't pester her, pester her

She won't say hello
Hello
Hello
She won't (all over the world)
Say hello
Hello
Hello
Nah nah she won't

My best friend, wish I could have went with her
Can't afford to visit her
Let alone stay
But I wanna, really wanna
Oh

We did everything together, now I'm missin' all the silly shit
The way she bit her bottom lip after we kissed
And it's enough
The Counting the days I'm praying are ya come back again


And now I sit at home, answer the phone missing
Wishing she would call
And say hello, say hello
I'm in the zone?
Readjusting to the fact she's been gone
And I'm alone, I'm alone


Keep playin' the same songs in my car
Hung up cause she ain't on the passenger, the passenger
And I can't even play madden any more
Oh no because I can't pester her, pester her

She my baby (baby), what am I to do without her?
Whoa I've been losing patience calling her


And now I sit at home, answer the phone missing
Wishing she would call
And say hello, say hello
I'm in the zone?
Readjusting to the fact she's been gone
And I'm alone, I'm alone


Keep playin' the same songs in my car
Hung up cause she ain't on the passenger, the passenger
And I can't even play madden any more
Oh no because I can't pester her, pester her

She won't say hello
Hello
Hello
She won't (all over the world)
Say hello
Hello
Hello
Nah nah she won't
