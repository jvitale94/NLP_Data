I'm trying to fix your cable box, again
Said you couldn't get channel 4
And that's the only one you wanted to watch


Last week I was walking your dog, baby
Scrubbing your dishes
Took your clothes to the cleaners
I don't mind, cause


When I'm done
When I'm done
I'm gonna get every little bit of your love
When I'm done (I'm gonna get it)
When I'm done (You're gonna get it)
You gonna feel every little bit of my love


Making love on the coffee table
Knock all the magazines off, yeah
You spilled your wine all over the floor
But guess who had to clean it up, yeah


Last week I was washing your towels
Scrubbing your dishes
Took your clothes to the cleaners
I don't mind, cause


When I'm done
When I'm done
I'm gonna get every little bit of your love
When I'm done (I'm gonna get it)
When I'm done (You're gonna get it)
You gonna feel every little bit of my love

When I'm done
When I'm done
I'm gonna get every little bit of your love
When I'm done (I'm gonna get it)
When I'm done (You gonna get it)
You gonna feel every little bit of my love


Well, gimme some more baby
Gimme some more
It's never enough baby
You gotta let me know
You need something, tell me something, gather something to hold
Baby I'll do it


When I'm done (when I'm done)
When I'm done (when I'm done)
I'm gonna get every little bit of your love
When I'm done (I'm gonna get it)
When I'm done (You gonna get it)
You gonna feel every little bit of my love

When I'm done
When I'm done
I'm gonna get every little bit of your love
When I'm done (I'm gonna get it)
When I'm done (You gonna get it)
You gonna feel every little bit of my love
