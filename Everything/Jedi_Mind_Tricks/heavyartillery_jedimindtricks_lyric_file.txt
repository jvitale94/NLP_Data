My hand fast like Ramadan when the night dawn
I'm the physical of Tsunami, you a slight storm
This is a spiritual anomaly, a fight song
To guard you now directly in my right palm
Nuffin' new about it, keep the ratchet with me lifelong
I come thru polar caps melt, ice gon'
My mother cryin' to my brother why is his life wrong?
Concrete God's school - Allahu Akbar!
Crooked D's in front of the crib inside a parked car
Gumar-Oz-Dubar inside the shot bar
Darts fly inside you and severe you like a shark star
If we ain't livin' in hell I'm tellin' you it's hot Ba
Masonic manifestation of God is not far
In reality the sun is just a star
The Earth is just a bowl of shit is where I stop Ba


"This blood spill fo'real"
"Heavy artillery in my facility"
"Betta call security, it's bout to be on"
"Your whole team is gettin' blown to smithereens"


I am cyber, I'm hundred miles of fiber
I am the proprietor of fire
I do not perspire, I fire as I so desire
I'm a stry as a fire, endire
I have tried the possible
I have gotten lightning in a bottle
My logic is not inside a novel
I am unconventional, incomprehensible
It's intentional, it's in general
It's in principle, I'm the sensitize to the cries
Blind eye to the mice
I'm despised by the skies, likewise
I am sand and stone, I stand alone
I'm a candle blown, I have hands and bone
I'm smart and old, I am dark and cold
I have a pawn shop apart; I have a heart of gold
I'm a heartless soul, it's my heart for stone
Death for all, let the closes star explode




Brrrrrrrtt... Rrrrrrrttt...
Osama Vin Laden
The God Jus Allah, Yo Kwestion where you at baby?
Frank Sinatra, Enemy of Mankind, whadup cuzo?
