



It's comin', it's comin'
You wear a gun, the beast 'til the end that is
This is the twilight winter
I am ready to be her son
It's now, I will RISE to her side!
I don't need the words, I'm  beyond


Keep it homie this is a gangsta party
Bullet proof glass for Robbie
Die sorry by the hand of vampires and zombies
Fire bombin' suicide army God's inside me
Ride 'til I motherfuckin' die high on canarcy
Unfocusable, 'xplodin smokin toast to ya vultures
Soldiers in haemoglobin words of evil spoken invokin'
Volcanoes evoked, these veterans are very violent
Non Phixion Jedi Mind Tricks a deadly virus
I could just go live no love
I read Kaballah on drugs
Gun in my wig gettin' my dick sucked
Bitches spit and cum on each others clits for kicks
Cocaine tits degenerates smother ya shit
Another day in paradise, surrounded by bloodsuckers and parasites
Gettin' in shoot outs for Amorites
Leave ya block flooded wid blood this hard find I promised
Eat shit suck fuck kill and die honest


The big bad fearless wolf
I'm the end of the world
Wearing the flesh of fallen angels
I've scanned the reality
I see it, the corruption of flesh
And blood to you all!


Call me the rap Che Guerera
Loungin' in the black grave's terror
I lace tracks wid terror forever smellin' death
Reoccurrin' like the hands of burnin' flesh
Must be the spirit of Koresh that keep me turnin' in the bed
Troopers hoverin', you'll be sufferin' crews be buggin'
When they rather shoot they brother than abuse the government
Our crews make compliments from writin' darkness
When we spark this the hardest part is when Gods is
dealing with fake artists,I face charges for speakin' my piece
Unleash the beast after nine eleven still got beef wid police
Streets' a warzone we more prone to violence and greed
No voice leaves no choice they tryna silence the seeds
Time is when will you get yours, stop relyin' on me
I'm firin' wid speed so before you dyin' you'll bleed
This is a war call I warn y'all stay up 'fore you're held
Or get fucked up cut up ya wrist and kill yaself


The flesh of fallen angels come to me all!
A secret, living on by the skin of reality
I am the wolf!, 'til the end
I don't need the words, I'm the beyond the words


These streets is Vietnam
I'm like Jesus tryna complete a song
I believe in Islam heathens can bleed 'til they gone
It's on, anyone can get hit
Anyone can get the centre of their energy split
My enemies fit, to face Palestine
You bitch rappers only got heart on Valentine's
And all ah y'all that wanna know how my metal feel
It gets settled in the temple when my baretta kill
My pen bleeds the ink y'all spill
But y'all still seem to think y'all real
Jedi Mind real put the nine to ya grill
We spit real, and y'all run for the hills
I stab you in the back 'til it weakens the knees
Then smash you wid a statue of Jesus that bleeds


I've tasted the devil's green blood
It runs in my veins
I've seen beyond the world
The architecture of blood and bone marrow
Death is coming!
I have tasted the flesh of fallen angels
I am the wolf yes!, I am the wolf!
