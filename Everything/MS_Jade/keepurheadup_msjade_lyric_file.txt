Keep your head up to the sky
Determination in your eye
You can hold me when it's cold
If you can only let me know, oh


Young girl lost, when is you gonna learn to love yourself
To trust him mean that you can't even trust yourself
He was a dog when you met him now you mad as shit
You can't change that man what you see is what you get
And just because he throw you out don't let him walk over you
Have some pride you're a woman make him respect you
Brought bitches for him
Took a couple stitches for him
He at his baby mom house while you wash his dishes for him
How you gon' play
Believe anything he say
Choose him over your family on any given day
I could tell you not happy crying yourself to sleep
Gotta hit out on his ass you still pushing his jeep
Your career ain't pursuing it
When miserable what's love got to do with it?
I know it's hard but you gotta do what's right for you
See can't nobody hurl over obstacles in life but you


Keep your head up to the skies
Determination in your eyes
You can hold me when it's cold
If you can only let me know, oh


Makes no sense
What us ladies gotta put up with
The backbone of ya niggaz and we put up with
Everything we hold y'all down when times is bad
Fuckin sis for two years now you know you're the dad
Tryna escape responsibilities be a man
And you won't even take a blood test nigga you ain't a man
Lie after lie said you'd always be there
That's fucked up cos the baby ain't asked to be here
Man she gotta struggle
Shakin her ass in a thong
Tryna make ends meet, stressed out all alone
Scraping up pimper money tryna keep her head focused
Hard to stay strong when better days seem hopeless
Everything happens for a reason it was written
Tried to make you stumble in this game but you didn't
Might seem tough but it will be alright girl
Get it together, do your thing, live your life girl


Keep your head up to the skies
Determination in your eyes
You can hold me when it's cold
If you can only let me know, oh


Got turned out now you went and got loose at the panties
Went from weed to pills to coppin nose candies
Ain't had a siege yet but you headed for the grave
Screwin everybody don't give a shit about AIDS
Lettin niggaz run through you and use you up
You don't know that shit could mentally abuse you up
A free suck in a big truck
Neighborhood niggaz callin you a free fuck
Your grandmother havin thoughts of gettin rid of you
Your mom's smokin you whorin that's pitiful
All kinds of thoughts is goin through your head make a change
Ain't used it in a long time but you got a brain
Get yourself together ma you better straighten up
It's hard as shit on your own plus you growin up
Go to school get a job make your own cash
Do what them niggaz gon' say when you walk past


Keep your head up to the skies
Determination in your eyes
You can hold me when it's cold
If you can only let me know, oh


Take my hand
I'm here
Tell me
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la


Keep your head up to the skies
Determination in your eyes
You can hold me when it's cold
If you can only let me know, oh
