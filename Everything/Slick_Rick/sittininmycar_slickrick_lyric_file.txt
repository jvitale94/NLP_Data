


Something tells Rick he's a fool
To let girls treat me so cruel
But never-the-less, Rick said "You got me waiting"
Sitting in my car, waiting for yoooooooooou-ooh-ooh, lalalala

I got a girl, but I'm about to switch all that
Because my girl be trying to play me like the bitch all that
Shoot, clocked her daughter, for acting out of order
To impress a girl who to me knocked her out the water!
But because the kid swears love
Though when I see her friend its like the shit wears off
I don't bother, while she want to kiss and then cuss and full of hate
Get her friend?  Mission Impossible
Because she's the one the hon chose to boast to
The way that her and the bitch is so close to be a waste
So make music in my basement
Don't cut her off till I find a good replacement
One day I jumped in my Jeep, drove her to her friend's
house, cause the hon was sleeping over
My girl was acting fine, then the slime switched
Wanna diss, I said "It's over you waste of time BITCH"
Tried to kiss her friend, twice then a third
She said "Stop, Rick", but didn't tell her friend a word
I went to bed, here come my girl touching me intently
Snuck out early, girlfriend wasn't acting as friendly as before
Because she swore a nigga hit her
"Well if you ain't love her why'd you go back to bed with her?"
But I didn't, now the hon badgering
I don't know, maybe it's me, maybe I'm imagining the love affair


Got Rick sitting right here
Waiting for you my dear
Wondering if you're ever gonna show, you hoe

Another brother out for one thing, mistook him for
Steady relationship is what I'm really looking for
Sincerity, scoop the hon I done it
I said "Being straight up, it's you I really wanted"
Though she fucked niggas with money like MAD
I still found myself wanting the honey quite bad
Loyal to her friend, though she wanted wood
Then we did it, boy that pussy was good
"But what if shorty finds out?"
Never be too clever
"Rick, she has to know if we're to ever be together"
Chill, then we started to button the strap and
Then my girl woke up, we acted like ain't nothing happened
Later on, my girlfriend stormed in
"We going to the supper club, some kid's performing
Bye, see you later", 
Her girlfriend hot, then stopped living, Rick decide to follow
I'm outside of the club sipping a beer through the best can
Both sluts were sliding numbers to the next man
Contradicting of words being together
My girl, too, I should've known, birds of a feather
Back in my Jeep, about 4:11
Popped another can, looked up to the heavens
I'm a good man, in fact I know that I am
And I deserve a lady love, that's why I'm wondering why I'm...


Sitting in my car, waiting for yoooooooooou-ooh-ooh, lalalala
Got Rick sitting right here
Waiting for you my dear
Wondering if you're ever gonna show, you hoe
Something tells Rick he's a fool
To let girls treat me so cruel
But never-the-less, Rick said, you got me waiting
Sitting in my car, waiting for yoooooooooou-ooh-ooh,
lalalala, lalalala, lalalala, lalalala

So you get my point son, 
you just don't trust no bitch, you know what I'm sayin?
"Okay, daddy, I understand"
Cause bitches ain't no good, you know what I'm sayin?
"Okay, I get your point"
Anyway, listen to this, check it out

1994, as the world gets trifer,
I'm wondering, the fuck I need a woman in my life for? (ya know)
Cause its like a nigga whole history
With you hoes been nothing but misery
First rater, five-one stood
Mad coke fiend though the bitch looked good
Met her at the fever
"What's going on, stranger?"
And like a fool took her in and tried to change her
I don't who I thought I's bluffing
That BITCH wasn't giving up that coke for nothing
"Oh you trying to dis, mister bougeois nigga
Yet back in the day, you used to smoke coke cigarettes too,
That type shit you ain't admitting"
Because, homegirl, I grew out of it, you didn't
Anyway, dead out of order
Came in with a sheepskin her ex-lover bought her
Who gave you that?
"My ex"
I said "Who?"
Believe she had the nerve to say "You can wear it too"

When I found strength to depart, I do
Withdrew, for something brand new
Someone who would be true
Yes I should find someone who would be true


Cause Ricky needs a love that's true
Truuuuuuuuuuue, oh dear, scooby dooby doo
Scooby doo doo

Then I met Sin,
Sweating the viking
A brown skinned fox, slim just like I like them
"What?  Sweating you?  Picture that, nerd.  Please"
Anyway, the bitch had herpes!  (you know)
Imagine me, the fool being the spouse
Doctor said I couldn't catch it unless I got aroused
Found out snooping in her bag what she got
Now why you ain't tell me?  You worthless slut!
"Because I loved you at the time and couldn't afford to"
You know homegirl should get the Oscar award for her lying
Anyway, stayed with the creep
One day, Sybil here, talking in her sleep
"Chris, wait," the bum bitch said
So loud till a motherfucker fell out the bed
Who the hell is Chris?  She putting up resistance
Until I caught her calling the nigga long distance
Had the nerve to dis patch loving
Boy am I lucky that I didn't catch nothing

When I found strength to depart, I do
Withdrew, for something brand new
Someone who would be true
Yes I should find someone who would be true


Cause Ricky needs a love that's true
Truuuuuuuuuuue, truuuuuuuuue
Indeed, I need a love that's true
It seems I need a love that's true
Oh dear, scooby dooby doo
Oh gosh, Scooby doo doo-ooh (doo-ooh)

Though happy I was free
The need for love was still in me
Got to the point where the need for it was killing me
Then I met short here, hanging with my cousin
Found out later how young the bitch was and
Though I done hit it and she opened up a world
And remind me of that song "Go Away, Little Girl"
It had to end because the bitch weren't loyal, and spoiled
"That's because I had you pussy whipped royal"
You see the type of shit a nigga was gonna marry?
You see the type of attitude the BUM BITCH carry?
Like oil and water, impossible mixture
Then temper tantrums came into the picture
Yelling (ahhhh), carrying on bad and cursing
Complete embarassment to The Ruler as a person
"Gimme shorts"
Ruler will not permit you
Then she goes wild, starts breaking up my furniture
Flirts too, excuse me, a whore
Like the world's worst groupie when I brought her on tour

So when I found strength to depart, I do
Withdrew, for something brand new
Someone who would be true
Yes I should find someone who would be true


Cause Ricky needs a love that's true
Truuuuuuuuuuue, truuuuuuuuue
Indeed, I need a love that's true
It seems I need a love that's true
Oh dear, scooby dooby doo
Oh gosh, Scooby doo doo
Ricky needs a love that's true-hoo-hoo
