I hate that snitch, I hate that sniiiiiiitch~!


Now listen up, all you hustlers - I got a story or two
I got to tell you 'bout these snitches, because they're snitchin on you
See we're known for 5th Ward and we take no jive
You're like a cat - but guess what - you don't have nines lives, and




NOW, you've, GOT, too
Beware of the snitch - homeboy they smile in your face
Within a few damn hours, he'll piss all over the place
You've got some snitches, homeboy and that's without doubt
But when the press comes out, he'll end up snitchin himself
Because I robbed, I stole, yo and Red got away
We all got got, you know why, because of snitchin away, and






And there's, snitches everywhere, and they brought in two
You got caught, crackin and they told on you
But me and dis homeboy was real cool you know
I took his girlie off with me and she gave me a blow
Now just imagine what happened, the very next day
The other fella snitched us on because they couldn't get no play, and




This is the end homeboy, well it's last but not least
Jukebox is gonna hip you to the jams we seek
Do-do-do-do-do-do you know that dance - yeah they call it the wop
But those snitches have a dance they call the crimstop, and




"I never trusted him, I never trusted him, I never trusted him"
"For all I know he had me set up"
