Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill...
Pussy nigga, turn up
Pussy nigga, turn up


Shit...
You ain't about that murder game
NFL, yeah, yeah, we run the murder game
I'm from 40th, them cops is doggin' us
I chilled on 39th 'cause them niggas ain't talk too much
They rob 'em, let the burner do it
I swear I miss the murder unit
Lynch Mob, Saint Day, Scream Team, 40 Walls, bang bang
I'll remove your melon – (shit, Killa, who you tellin'?)
And the girls don't fuck with you, they be like "who he tellin'?"
In furs you'll find me – birds and hymens
I don't know La La Crew, but I got the murder mind
Sophie and Katrina, baby
Keep the nines a ninas, in Newark, subpoenas, baby
Count that – (blah, blah, blah, how 'bout that?)
(He a cigarette nigga, let me out that) –
Left 'em stinkin' like a loud pack


So what you talkin' 'bout?
(You ain't about that murder game)
Back up, we in the burbs with 'caine
Swervin' lanes, curvin' lames
Bang, bang, bang you heard the thing
(Pussy nigga, shut up)
(Pussy nigga, shut up)
Ah...


You know I got that heroin – I take it down to Maryland
You know them vets need they medicine
Fiends knock - hurry up and let 'em in
Papi came to see me, yeah, I'm feelin' lucky now
Got that dog food, I ain't talkin' puppy chow
No gravy train - no Purina
No Kibbles & Bits, so money train that real ether
That beige and tan, made me a praying mantis
Made three mil' alone, Ohio State campus
They stuck on basic, it's bucks I'm chasin'
Harlem World forever but I rep that Buka Nation
I could talk about it – statute imitations up
They can't indict me know, know them charges never stuck
You relate? We buildin' – we'll take your building
We on the lobby, one month, we'll make a million




You ain't about that murder game
Pussy nigga, shut up
