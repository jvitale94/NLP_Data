Why the flesh eatin disease make niggaz get ate her
Why bitches with a fat ass gotta wear A cup
Why Dave Listern from the NBA-a
Why the great ones always break up
And when travisty happen they wanna make up
Why niggaz can't get caked up and stay caked up

Why Adam and Eve didn't know what was in the garden dun
Why niggaz from America always wanna cart to foreign land

Why beef with my mom why can't sleep when I cum
Why my black I love every fight I laugh when they mug me every right

Run deep in my ways six feet deep in our graves
Why periods last three to five days
Why we ain't retreated to slaves
Why we don't learn til we leave for the cage
And we say the beasts is in rage
Why I can't tell you the whole story just a piece of the page
Whys no such thing as true lies
Why can't I have two rather than few highs
Whys homos got to do guys in the world
Why ain't there more girls that wanna do girls
Whys multiple-sclorosis why got multiple intosis
You know my .45 my .357 but why my shotgun why plot dun
Why man in statue depend on his rocks son
Why my hood fight flurges I see crook type murders

Why she rub it against her mouth like it's chap stick
Why this rap shit

Yo why you all wanna see me blow
Why the rederick why I can't get my proper etiquette
