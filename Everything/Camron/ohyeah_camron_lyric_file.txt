Everybody talking bout "Flea What you going to do?"
I'm a do what I want when I want
Okay, welcome back


Yo, he want to play with me, man
I play with triggers
Took the oven off my waist
Started bakin' niggas
Doctor brought her back to life
I'm like, y'all breathin' niggas
Went in the ER, told 'em stop savin' niggas
Hood investor, silver Tesla
Check my dresser, I'm the best dresser
Who dress better?
Salad nigga, you dress lettuce
What's his address?
I'll address him like you address letters
Kanye daughter, pink fur and white tee
Sorry, Mike, the kids want to be "Like Flea"
Like me, make a movie, no Spike Lee
Tell girls politely
"Come to the crib, it's icy"


And they be like (oh yeah)
And I be like (oh yeah)
I hit your girl with the fall away
Tell her look, we gon' have a ball today
All the way, all she say yeeeeeah
And I be like (oh yeah)
And she be like (oh yeah)
We turning up (oh yeah)


Cut your wrist, I cut the deck
I tell corporate
Cut the shit, cut the check
We used to beatbox at weed spots
Me, I turned Reeboks to Flee-boks
Kicks are like heroin or green tops
Either way I had the line wrapped three blocks
Only thing you shooting man is cheap shots
I tell models, "Please squat, eat cock" (slurp)
And they be like (oh yeah)
Play with me you need not
Shit, I got more flavor than a peacock
Don't listen in, or get eavesdropped
Seen his crew, middle finger I greet them all
You, you, and you, I'm talking to all three of y'all
Tell strippers, look I believe in y'all
Call me mañana, let's see the mall
I'm treating y'all


And they be like (oh yeah)
And she be like (oh yeah)
Soon as they see me
I do it like I'm doing it for TV
Believe me, it's easy, they like (oh yeah)
Girls like (oh yeah)
They looking like (oh yeah)
I go anywhere and burn it down
I told honey, look I get money, turn around
She was like (oh yeah)
She was like (oh yeah)
And I was like (oh yeah)


So rugged, but the hoes love it
Cold-blooded niggas don't want it
My jewels, gold clustered and stone studded
Bitch in the shower, bone crushing and soap sudded
Everybody dead, Dipset's most wanted
And I still got a boatload of coke coming
Selling that Nino Brown, getting that G money
Nickel rock, ki money, half oz money
Let me chill, cause niggas got that speak money
Talk to police money, get out of jail free money
You got that , I got that "capiche" money
Got that "where the fuck is my title?"
You got that lease money


And they be like (oh yeah)
And she be like (oh yeah)
Soon as they see me
I do it like I'm doing it for TV
Believe me, it's easy, they like (oh yeah)
Girls like (oh yeah)
They looking like (oh yeah)
I go anywhere and burn it down
I told honey, look I get money, turn around
She was like (oh yeah)
She was like (oh yeah)
And I was like (oh yeah)
