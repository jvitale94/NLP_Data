Chka-UHH, chka-yeah
Ladies and gentlemen
Saukrates!


Have you ever been so proud in your life
You livin on your own cloud in the sky
Wanna take e'rybody wit'chu
Forget one, lemme get two


Yeah! Yo, hey
I love travellin and seein people
Showin the ignorant my color skin is equal
I like tryin different thai food and seafood
Makin my episode of life another sequel
I like flyin on Delta and Continental
First class, playin them elevator instrumentals
I'm in the window, got on my headphones
Listenin to Big Pun and Wyclef Jean
It's like Exxon, I get gassed up
I shuffle 'round the board like Cassius
That's us when the plane land, hey man
It ain't hard cause I can do it like a caveman
Fix my Ray-Bans, I hit the hotel
Do my show, get my money, hit the hotel
Sittin at the hotel like "Oh well!"
I call shorty that I met today at Modell's
Go girl, it's like we in The Matrix
I'm in a new city, with suitcases
I'm overseas with bills with new faces
And if you're not about that you need a facelift
Yup!




Lemme get two, lemme get two 
Lemme get two, bartender lemme get two
Yo
If it's a high life you seekin then you say it
Cause how the hell you gonna win the game if you ain't playin?
I'm in Monaco, swimmin in the deep end with 3 dimes, this ain't dominos
Well maybe it was, I set 'em up to knock 'em down and go
The skeletons in the closet, I'm makin a new deposit
She was never so erotic 'til we got to the ex-o-tic
-tic, now I'm thinkin
that this time bomb is about to explode
Got me wishin that it was different than money, contradiction is funny
I just told y'all to play the game if y'all wan' eat
The truth is it's what you make it
That's why I got my baby girl naked
Long before I bought them tickets to Turks and Caicos
We love each other, beyond under covers
That's why I'm feelin so high like them Wright brothers
Fly, I hope it never take material
for you to get yo' Applejax cereal, here we go




Lemme get two, lemme get two 
Lemme get two, bartender lemme get two


I'm on vacation BEITCH!
And I'm flyin high
