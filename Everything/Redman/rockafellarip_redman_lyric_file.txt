Sat down and opened my mind and said it's time
For me to design the right lines
Make you one of a kind boy rough and tough and all that stuff
Sure enough I'll make the brother's change their minds
Then you understand my only principle
No need to fuck with the born invincible
I'm rated X like a porno feature
Leaving MC's dazed, and catching anesthesias
Even females get rocked when they try to cock  
Block the man from doing this hip-hop
Techniques unique and that's my word is bond
Rockafella's the name but the screaming I'll rock on
