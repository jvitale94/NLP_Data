Yo Timbaland, see what they don't understand
Is we about to flip our whole style on 'em for two double zero one
And for those of you who hated
You only made us more creative
Misdemeanor

You don't want to speak my name
Mess around and get that ass blown away
Full gon' away, I never like your tail anyway
Missy got somethin' to say
I ride down the block in an Escalade
Bling, bling all in your face
I think you might need to put on your shades
I know you feel me though
Ya hatin' on me but you hear me though
Twenty inch rims sittin' crazy low
I'ma crazy hoe
I'ma keep the party live
Me and Timbaland gon' flip it tonight
Keep your hands in the sky
Wave 'em round like ya crazy high

Time to lick shots
Time to see you dance
Hey you, why you frontin'?
Time to lick shots
Time to see you dance
Hey you, why you frontin'?

You don't know who I be?
Your mommy never told you not to fuck with me
If I give you head you'll never leave
Stop sweatin' me
Flip it on the black hand side
Look here boy, don't you even try
Make me dislocate your spine
My rings put the shine like turpentine
What you comin' round here now fo'?
Baby hell no you just want my doe
Get your black tail on the flo'
Fool touch me that's a no, no
Mr. D.J. won't you play that song
Tell them freaks shake they nasty thongs
Hey boys won't you sing along
'Cause we gon' rock the party 'till the early morn'

Time to lick shots
Time to see you dance
Hey you, why you frontin'?
Time to lick shots
Time to see you dance
Hey you, why you frontin'?

Y'all don't hear me
You got your guns but you don't scare me
Originality is leary
My only style and I ain't sharin'
Hey y'all
Let's turn it up and tear the club down
Grab your drinks and give me two rounds
I'll break you off I'm goin' down down
Watch yourself, I'm about to turn it up

Time to lick shots
Time to see you dance
Hey you, why you frontin'?
Time to lick shots
Time to see you dance
Hey you, why you frontin'?

Listen, listen

Time to lick shots
Time to see you dance
Hey you, why you frontin'?
Time to lick shots
Time to see you dance
Hey you, why you frontin'?
