[** feat. Lil Wayne:]


[Missy Elliott:]
Baby what's up with you tonight*
You wanna get busy I can read your mind,
Baby, I can see you looking,
Pour some champagne and you might get lucky,
Touch on me, touch on me,
Gimme gimme honey,
I don't want ya, want ya money,
I just want you get on me,
Come on,
I've been checking you from across the room,
Money ain't a thing baby, what it do,
Ain't no need to keep on waiting,
Tell them other b-tches they can keep on hatin,
It's you that I want and I want what I want,
And I get it, get it, get it, get it, get it,

[Chorus:]
It's all for you,
Don't you turn it down
Til I show you my move,
You won't be disappointed,
Hey there shorty let me get that thang,

[Lil Wayne:]
Uhhhhm
I know what you're looking for
Got you butt naked in the condo cooking for
A n-gga like Weezy, please say the baby
And just like I'm begging I please all the ladies
Ease off the Richtor Scale, lil girl
Make you feel it in your pussy to your f-ckin' fingernails
I'm a beast with it baby, you ever had it beasted?
Leave that thing pink like Easter
Kiss ya on each of ya lips, yep all four of 'em
Dammn, shawty just won't let go of 'em
She gone need more of 'em, I leave that thing wetter
I beat that thing up and then I kiss it 'till it's better
