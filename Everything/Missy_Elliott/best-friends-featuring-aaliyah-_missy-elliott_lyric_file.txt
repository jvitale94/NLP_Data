Hey yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah

My best friend say, she sick of me cryin' on the phone
Tellin' how the men are doggin' me
My best friend say, don't tell her nothin' 'bout me can you girl
She ain't showin' me no sympathy

My best friend say, if she was me
She'd let you go long long time ago
My best friend say, my best friend say
I'll be there

I'll still be there for you in your time of need
You can lean on me, come on
I'll be there for you

I'll be there for you in your time of need
You can lean on me, come on
I'll be there for you

My best friend say, I can stay with her
At her house no doubt any time I like
My best friend say, don't let you ruin my life
'Cuz you don't do for me and you don't act right

My best friend say, if she was me
She would let you go long long time ago
My best friend say, my best friend say

I'll still be there for you in your time of need
You can lean on me, come on
I'll be there for you

I'll be there for you in your time of need
You can lean on me, come on
I'll be there for you

Hey hey yeah
Hey hey hey
Hey hey yeah
I'll be there for you

I'll be there for you in your time of need
You can lean on me, come on
I'll be there for you

I'll be there for you in your time of need
You can lean on me, come on
I'll be there for you

I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
