Uh, hit me

Don't explain, you never change
Same old thing, same old game
Say ya want to be wit' me
But show me my ring, baby, let me think

I been in the cold
The story untold, about to unfold
How do you expect me
To ever believe, you won't be wit' me

Why you all in my grill?
Can you pay my bills?
Let me know if you will
'Cause a chick gotta live

Talk is talk and talk is cheap
Tell it to her, don't say it to me
'Cause I know I'm in control
See tricks are for kids and boo I'm too old

Go 'head with your games
Don't ever come back to me again
Where you go, remember me
I'm the best thing in history

Why you all in my grill?
Can you pay my bills?
Let me know if you will
'Cause a chick gotta live

Third time
I moved you in, took you back in my life
I don't know, what's wrong with me
Third time
I moved you in, took you back in my life

Why you all in my grill?
Can you pay my bills?
Let me know if you will
'Cause a chick gotta live

Why you all in my grill?
Can you pay my bills?
Let me know if you will
'Cause a chick gotta live

If you want me, where's my dough?
Give me money, buy me clothes
No need for talking, have my dough
Where's my money, where's my clothes

If you want me, where's my dough?
Give me money, buy me clothes
No need for talking, have my dough
Where's my money, where's my clothes

Aight, uh
While you all in my grill, I'm thinkin' it's time to chill
But you want to drill though
I couldn't even step out the baby blue Bonneville
'Cause you be tryna kill my hoe
My girlfriend, and people around me is tellin' me that
You's a stalker like Darth Vader takes a Skywalker
I told you I was the street talker

It ain't my fault you wearin' your Victoria's Secrets
And your Frederick's
You wanted the Waldorf Astoria but instead I took you to Cedrick's
To entertain you, to do you to the G, and never claim you
Me and Missy, we gettin' straight fucked, boo
Yeah we puffin' up one of them thangs too

You blamin' boo, you maimin' who
I know you ain't bringin' that lame crew
Big Boi, and them phat sacks she pretty D, all they same boo
But I'm back by the dungeon family
So you can go 'head wit' all that stabbin' me
'Cause I will jab the, and slam the and Bobby Boochet yo' ass
Gee yeah, huh
