Please stand up
In 2005 the industry will be pussy whipped
It won't be easy

Mommy look good

They like mommy with the cute face, "Can I get a date?"
Mommy got a cute shape, mommy make 'em wait
Papi havin' trouble trynna keep up the pace
Mommy got the faith, I let my pussy be the bait

Mommy got the good shit, that really good shit

Mommy got them niggas goin' crazy for the ass

Wake up real early with my braids lookin' curly
