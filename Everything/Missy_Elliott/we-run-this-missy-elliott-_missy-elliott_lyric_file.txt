My style can't be duplicated or recycled
This chick is a sick individual
Sick tape, volume 2, believe it, oh, oh
Let me switch up the game

I drink that cognac
Step back 'cause I might put it on ya
I go deep, so deep till you sleep
Count sheep, wake you up from fuckin' all week

You don't want me here to show ya
How freak bitch act when I ain't soba
Word up, I'm tore up, sho' nuff
I ain't scared to take it off, tell the freak to take it off

Tipsy and it feel good
Black dudes got big woods
Into it, I do it, I did it
If you really, really want it then nigga stop frontin'

Hey boy, you know I'm your type
5'2 and wear my jeans real tight
My curves, they swerve, so superb
My word is my word and I came to serve

(We run this)
Run this
(We run this)
Run this
(We run this)
(Oh, oh, oh)

It don't matter where you from, it's where you at
And if you came to freak-a-leak, better bring your hats, loco
East coast, West coast, down South
Represent your coast

Yeah, we run it, yeah, we run it
Y'all don't want it 'cause my coast run it, oh
We run this shit, we run this shit

Wanna pull my hair, break my back
For the right money, might sit in your lap
Back to back, I can't even keep track
It's a fact, the freaks love to get slapped

Suck my toes, I need a back rub
I don't come to do it, I just wanna be touched
Look at how y'all makin' me blush
I'm enough to go around, so people, don't push

Wanna run that tush in the bush
Don't my diamonds look real good?
And they shine so hard that he glittas
So many karots they look like crittas

And we can do it all night
Take a flashlight to see up in my windpipe
I like to keep a nigga hype
I wanna know, can you handle my mic?

(We run this)
Run this
(We run this)
Run this
(We run this)
(Oh, oh, oh)

It don't matter where you from, it's where you at
And if you came to freak-a-leak, better bring your hats, loco
East coast, West coast, down South
Represent your coast

Yeah, we run it, yeah we run it
Y'all don't want it 'cause my coast run it, oh
We run this shit, we run this shit

Any hustla's in the party y'all? Hell ya
If you's a pimp let me see ya party on, hell ya
Oh strippas, take yo clothes off, hell ya
Y'all superstars, y'all don't need no bodyguards, hell ya

Nigga, I bow guard
A lot of rappers fake way too hard
Pull up at the club in a rental car where the freaks at
Freaks at da bar where da hard drinks are

Don't start, if you don't want beef
Don't take it that far with a superstar
I got my foot on the clutch, see me bounce my butt
Misdemeanor too much and I don't give a fuck

(We run this)
Run this
(We run this)
Run this
(We run this)
(Oh, oh, oh)

It don't matter where you from, it's where you at
And if you came to freak-a-leak, better bring your hats, loco

(We run this)
Run this
(We run this)
Run this
(We run this)
(Oh, oh, oh)

Represent your coast and act like you know
Know how to act 'fore you step your two feet in the do'
