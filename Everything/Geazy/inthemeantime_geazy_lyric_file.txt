Migos
Mustard on the beat ho
Yo, the party don't start
Yo, the party don't start
Woah, oh, oh


The party don't start 'til we walk in
I usually don't leave until the thing end
And in the meantime, I'm in between times
She workin' an other one, and I'm workin' mine, yeah, yeah
Said the party don't start, not 'til we walk in, not 'til we walk in
If you're feelin' like money, if you're lookin' like money
Throw your motherfuckin' hands in the air
Said the party don't start 'til we walk in
I usually don't leave until the thing end
And in the meantime, I'm in between times
She workin' an other one, and I'm workin' mine


Yeah, whole squad slides through, I'm hoppin' out last
Cause Gerald ain't comin' 'til we count cash, (Nah)
If it looks about right then we can walk inside, (Okay)
This is every day to us, I'm not just talkin' jive, (Yeah)
Cause you can count on us to bring the hoes out, (true)
Roped off in the section where it's closed out
Girls crowd around they all got they phones out
Pointed at me, takin' Snapchats tryna post 'bout "Oh my God it's him"
Gee, the party is too radical (Yeah)
They got me on display like a zoo animal (Damn)
What I'm sayin ' right now this is too factual (Facts!)
You gotta have it, it ain't no how-to manual (Nah)
Yeah, cause everybody just ain't got the juice
I don't know who let these imposters loose
If she ain't fuckin' then I toss the deuce (Yeah)
If you ain't livin' to the fuckin' fullest then what the fuck's use?


The party don't start, not 'til we walk in

And in the meantime, I'm in between times
She workin' an other one, and I'm workin' mine, yeah, yeah
Said the party don't start, not 'til we walk in, not 'til we walk in
If you're feelin' like money, if you're lookin' like money
Throw your motherfuckin' hands in the air
Said the party don't start, not 'til we walk in
And I usually don't leave until the thing end
And in the meantime, I'm in between times
She workin' an other one, and I'm a work mine


Uh, shit's lit but when I leave it'll die quick (Die quick)
You chase 'em all night, I pick
A fly chick, a magician, know a nice trick
Opened her mouth then she did a disappearing act with my dick, impressive
Sometimes you gotta chill, take a quick vacation
Took my down bitch with me, cause you patient
People spreading bullshit and misinformation
If I show up at a party it's a lit-uation
To sweep all of this cash you need a giant broom
Living faster than someone who know's they're dying soon
Sidepiece will be arriving soon
I told the promoter I'm a either need the office or a private room, ha, ha, ha
Security's like, "Hold up you can't be in here." (What?)
I said " Bitch I am the reason all these people here."
Check the flier, see this clear?
Yes now... if you would not mind fucking off this girl would like to suck my penis here
Eazy
