Don't fuck with me


Yeah, so roll one on some chill shit
I was deep asleep, on my Kill Bill shit
But now I'm back for it all tryna steal shit
You should know my fans are the ones I keep it real with
Word
That's the reason I'm still afloat
You would tread in water while I went to build a boat
Fool, you would probably drown in a little moat
I'm G-O-A-T, your a billy goat


I know I've been gone a long time (Been gone a long time)
I'm back and I want what is mine (I want what's mine)
I know I've been gone a long time (Been gone a long time)
I'm back and I want what is mine (I want what's mine)


Uh, I'm just a hero that was unsung
But in time they will see I'm truly someone
But don't mistake it though I love where I come from
Work I put in that could never be undone
I got a move man this movement you begun one?
My whole team on my back weighing one ton
And I've been burning heavy ever since blunt one
Ask about plan B that's a tough one
But as long as I can catch a flight home to a sold out show full of fans then I'm on
That's why I know I'll find a fortune that's suitable and live like a king
Everyday life's beautiful


I know I've been gone a long time (Been gone a long time)
I'm back and I want what is mine (I want what's mine)
I know I've been gone a long time (Been gone a long time)
I'm back and I want what is mine (I want what's mine)
