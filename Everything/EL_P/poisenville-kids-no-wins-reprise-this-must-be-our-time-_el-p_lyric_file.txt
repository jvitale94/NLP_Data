This is the sound of what you don't know killing you
This is the sound of what you don't need still true
This is the sound of what you don't want still in you
Never again

When a live wire lights little metal rail right
When a marvel of engineering steered me clear in to the plight
Right before the bodegas open, after the peak of night
Before the paper's delivered, I sat on the corner and sparked a light

The same corner I perched when I zone dropped on the block first
At almost 5 O'clock watching for sun spots or store clerks
Alone spot, almost kinda like the zone was forgot
As if the grid had been reset and couldn't catch to the clock

Or the stoop was stuck in the past a half minute
And I sat in it
With a loosie Newpy drift out of my lips, taste, half minted
Come on

And I felt like a hundred bucks in the pocket of a gambling lush
At a Wondershowzen flow with the druids of destructo luck
Fugitoid on the run again, the sky gleamed, the maroonist coloring
Layered against the bluest tone from where the thunder lived

Here I was directly under it like some dejected little gray
And they told to stay and wait for the mothership
A cotton ball in a blizzard of mischief or brain prison
With a thought that rode on the bus and came for conjugal visits

And fucked it's way into my gray matter, the tattered territory
Stayed chattering and nagging till it demanded it yell it for me
And I tried to hold the thing back', but the meditation was otherly
Fixated on what a friend said and relating it to my struggling

Metropoloid void so damn smothering
But we were children of poisenville
And saw the seduction less repugnant

And reserved the right as the triggerman
With the back up plan of self destruction
And I touched the type of chemicals
That could pull me towards that function

It's the stuff I find hard for discussion
How the fuck do you explain
Your our own self destruction
And still remain trusted?

To answer the question, yes, the city wants you gone
And thats the only thing connecting us
But the connection is so strong
So how dare you assume that I'll sleep when you're dead
This is well outside the boundaries of acceptable behavior

I will not give you the go ahead
And you will not be remembered fondly
I'm throwing down the gauntlet
Fuck you, this isn't your decision

And for all the holy fuck I give
Your little spectacle is ended
But don't think for just one second
You've honored your obligations to me

I'm serious, look in my eyes
I don't find this funny or whatever you imagine poetry
And justice feels like when you combine them
I am not going to allow this on my watch buddy
Nobodies impressed with your imagined sacrifice
Device or insurmountable regret

You are not uniquely pained
And if you go we won't be sorry
And who the hell are you to put me through
The banality of watching this

Cause many better men have gone
For clearly better reasons
And I starkly must remind you
That you have not even been trying

And that's the only thing
Remarkable about you
Stop me if I'm lying

We are always outnumbered but we were never out militiad
There's no dignity for criminals, no ministry for the wicked
In this town if you make a sound
You're the leper with the most fingers

The league of extraordinary nobodies
The other teams bringing in ringers
No faith in the majority, no hope for the little ones
Sally pulled a pistol out, Billy got a blunderbuss

So what the fuck are you feeling
That makes your struggle so wondrous?
Enough to arrogantly pull
What's left of the rug out from under us?

I think not, you're in the same barrel
All us other crabs are caught
And if I have to live, you have to live
Whether you like this shit or not
Come on

Dedicated to the drowning, and the noble futility of
The desperate friends forced to watch
And to my good friends who refused
To allow it to happen to me

You know who you are
You know what I'm talking about
Believe me, man, I promise

Never, never, never, gonna get that way again
Never, never, never, gonna get that way again
Never, never, never, gonna get that way again
Never, never, never, gonna get that way again

Never, never, never, gonna get that way again
Never, never, never, gonna get that way again
Never, never, never, gonna get that way again
Never, never, never, gonna get that way again
Never, never
