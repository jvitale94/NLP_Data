Keep me in the sky, that's all that I cry
I'll become your servant if it's worth your time
Keep me in the sky, that's all that I'll say
I'll become your soldier, at least for this day

Keep me in the sky, that's all that I cry
I'll become your servant if it's worth your time
Keep me in the sky, that's all that I'll say

I know I haven't been walkin a humble path
I know I cursed at your name and then laughed
And though I found it inane to bend calf
The servitude of grovelin framed as pained task

I gotta figure it, can't hurt to ask
Suspension of disbelief in uniquely freak flash
Admission of the faithfully shaken, now trapped
30 thousand and droppin, it's on and poppin at last

Keep me in the sky, that's all that I cry
I'll become your servant if it's worth your time
Keep me in the sky, that's all that I'll say
I'll become your soldier, at least for this day

Everybody get your ticket today
Flyentology
Welcome aboard, sir, right this way

Flyentology, flyen-flyentology
Our bible is in your seat back pocket
Tuck your head between your legs, now pray

I adore you the same way that the others always adored you
Emergency, humility, just break glass
I implore with no knowledge of dogma to conform to
I know I don't deserve it but save my ass

And if I'm goin down, let me do it in first class
The paganistic prayer of a heathen with wild past
Please forgive my bastardized style dash
And anoint me with salvation in form of non-crash

I wanna live so bad
All my life I've been so arrogant
This is the vessel of my wakenin
Please Father, put Your hand out, carry it

I wanna live so bad
All my life, I've been so arrogant
This is the vessel of my wakenin
Goddamn it, put Your hand out, carry it
