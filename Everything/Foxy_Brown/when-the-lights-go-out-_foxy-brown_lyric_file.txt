Woah, Ill na na, woah
BK, woah
One, two, three, four

I'm good, buckle up 'cause you know we about to go
Take a trip to a place somewhere like outer space
Don't be scared, I'm the captain
Anything can happen to you boy but I won't hurt you boy

My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard
Do the fuckin' thing like a porno star
Me and my girls real hard in the Bentley Arnage
In a white line skirt and chinchilla fur

My bitch Tiff keep a bottle of Cris
In a glass top six and that's my bitch
F double O. X. B. double O. G. I. E
My na na na na tastes like Jamaican kiki

Ain't a bitch freaky like me
When the lights go out I'm show you what I'm about
Matter fact playboy open you mouth
Come here, lemme take you on a tour down south

Baby when the lights go out
I want you to show me what you really all about
Baby when the lights go out I'm gonna light up your life
Take you for a ride on this roller coaster

Theme park, thrill ride, main attraction, let's ride
Baby when the lights go out I'm gonna light up your life
Take you for a ride on this roller coaster

I only met one nigga that deserved it
He a gangsta so he worth it
I make them pretty boys nervous

Y'all already know who this is
The bitch that will throw it back vicious
I like it rough, I ain't them other rap bitches

Throw it up in mad positions from the bathroom to the kitchen
On the table, fuck the dishes
They fall to the floor while I give you the business

See I'm so flexible I'll stretch and pull that ass up real properly
Can't fuck with the ill na na
Can't fuck with the ill na na
Can't fuck with the ill na na
One, two, three, four

Baby when the lights go out
I want you to show me what you really all about
Baby when the lights go out I'm gonna light up your life
Take you for a ride on this roller coaster

Theme park, thrill ride, main attraction, let's ride
Baby when the lights go out I'm gonna light up your life
Take you for a ride on this roller coaster

The boy can't handle the na na
Let him put one hand on the na na
Then I'll let him get a sniff of the na na
Boy came to quick for the na na

Then I'll let him get a lick of the na na
Let that boy get stiff than a na na
See my pun-pun print to the fellas
Something like the black medallion bein' worth it

Boy relax your mind it will be alright
Just hold on and open your eyes
Till lights go out cause I'm a light up your life
So what you're gonna do

Baby when the lights go out
I want you to show me what you really all about
Baby when the lights go out I'm gonna light up your life
Take you for a ride on this roller coaster

Theme park, thrill ride, main attraction, let's ride
Baby when the lights go out I'm gonna light up your life
Take you for a ride on this roller coaster
