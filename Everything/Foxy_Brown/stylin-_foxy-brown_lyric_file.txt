Fever baby
Okay, alright Brooklyn
Uh oh, uh oh
Yeah, uh huh

Bitches throw ya drinks up
Style when we be comin' in
Niggas throw ya guns up
While when we be runnin' in

And all that ain't nothin
We at the bar frontin'
Its necessary
We stays in Burburry
(Who)

You know how it go
Fox and Gav
In a navy blue Rov
Stuttin' in Halo

On the I-95, keepin' it live
In the hood, in the 5
Front of Kennedy Fried
(Who)

Then slide off with a NBA jump off
Or a nice lil' rapper
Whoever money stack up
Duke, Cop a little H-Tod shoe
And them little boxer dudes
Get a watch or two
(Whoa)

It ain't greed
Y'all got kids to feed
Fuck it, all he wanna do is
Kill it and leave

So, lay low and throw
The pussy like the free throw
Brooklyn broad and bet
I keep the heat low

We styles in Burburry
And our walk is mean
In them Frankie B. jeans boy

It's necessary
We stays in Burburry
And a Mark Jacob bag
And a H-Tod shoe

We stays in Burburry
And a Mark Jacob bag

When we walk up in the club
Niggas be like, 'Oh!'
They ain't got no dough?
Bet we be like, 'No!'

We 'bout our paper and all that fam
Rollin' through Planet Hollywood
Knockin' that Killa Cam
(Whoa)

Up in V.I.P. with F.B.
With a nice throw back
Right below a good G
Now, dude is ill, I'm lovin his boys
I'm all, seeing he's gangsta
I'm watching him swift now

They wanna see us
Bitches they wanna be us
Fox and Althea in a powder blue two seater
We the truth in our Juicy sweat suits
When we come through ya town
Everything shut down

It's necessary
We styles in Burburry
And our walk is mean
In them Frankie B. jeans boy

We stays in Burburry
And a Mark Jacob bag

20's with the rims
B-custom kitted Bentley
And everything we do
They assist like Jamaal Tinsley

Cocky bastard
I only spits acid
Slept on Broken Silence
Fever 'bout to smash it

This here's a classic
We keeps it drastic
I'm all engaged, engaged to dough
And married to plastic

And you know how we do
Fresh pair Air Force 2's
With the toaster
Kobe pull over
(Whoo)

We styles in Burburry
And our walk is mean
In them Frankie B. jeans boy
