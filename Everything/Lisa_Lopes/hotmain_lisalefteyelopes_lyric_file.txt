She's the one you thought would never do a solo LP
Yeah, now what chick could outsell me?
Drama comes in dozens and I know you love it
A rose is still a rose, so I rose above it
The more that they see the woman got a mind of her own
The less that they want a part of my throne, it figures
But the more they compare me to the ones they could own
They know they never should have left me alone
I'm bigga
No doubt
Money gang and my G's is up
Treat me like David Blaine and freeze me up
Let me address the issue 
I'm super not superficial
Spoil me
The only statement I'm makin' is royalties (rock the dollars)
Seven digits never under my bank account hold
Numbers like your phone number, plus area code
Gamble with your career 
Go ahead chance her
See what happened with scrubs on my records
Deserve answers

Oh Left Eye 
What's happenin'?
Everybody wanna know where the hell you been
Oh Left Eye
Teachers, children, mothers, and thugs
Everybody loves Miss Left Eye
What's happenin'?
Everybody wanna know where the hell you been
Oh Left Eye
Teachers, children, mothers, and thugs
Everybody loves Miss Left Eye

Whole bunch of names on your credit in pubs
Tryin' to be loved
I'm 30 mill and a fan club
What you got signed for 
I spent on some rugs
DVD's and TV's and that's just in the car
Borderline genius 
Scientists swear by me
Imagine Einstein in Carmen Jones's body
Gave you auditions
They say I'm a gymnast in business
My summersault your positions
Waste not whatnot
I don't want your nothing
On top she's hot
No discussion
I'm a diva
Teacher (to the rap game)
Here when it started I'll be here when it change
Started more careers than Quincy Jones
Other rap chicks actin' funny since she's home
Do it again and again
Expect her to
Left Eye you expect me to respect you too
