Cocaine flow, cocaine dough
Where that money, where that paper, where that cocaine go?
Lay 'em down, face first, take the numbers out his cell
Get his connect to gag him, so the faggot don't yell

"Help! I'm being robbed!" 


What happened to that street shit you rap about?
Where that spot that you sell heron, and dope and all that crack about
Niggas stop fronting, you don't own a glock
If I take it off your neck, you probably call the cop, it's like

"Help! I'm being robbed!" 


Aiyo, I had to shove the fifth in his mouth
He tried to raise the price on me in the spring, in the midst of a drought
Told him papi, no need, just put the slabs in the bag
Then I told him shut the fuck up but his dog even said "arf! arf!"

"Help! I'm being robbed!" 


'88 Riker's Isle, banging for phone time
One big nigga slid through, bulky with two shines
Winked at my goons, they leave quick, big man ran
To the bubble, leaking, repeating that help shit

"Help! I'm being robbed!" 


We smack niggas up, shake 'em down as we see 'em
Take his jewelry and his podium
Sheek and Ghostface on our '88 shit, get your chest hit
Box cutter, get your face split, they yelling like!

"Help! I'm being robbed!" 


Out of respect, I through the gun to his neck, he had singles and loose change
And yo, four bundles of wet
Told him, yo, kid, respect the juks, and there's one thing
You shouldn't yell around murderous crooks and that's

"Help! I'm being robbed!"
