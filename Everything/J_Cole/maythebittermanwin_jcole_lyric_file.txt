on one hand I'm happy for her, because she smilin 
and I think about the times that she smiled for me
On the other hand I'm bitter and well, inside I'm dyin' 
cause she loves him and she ain't got no time for me
And her new boyfriend is so clever over heard a couple of her friends tellin' her he better than me 
And despite all the spite that builds with each passing night 
I can't help but think they right because he never did cheat (never did cheat, true)
And there is no excuse I can use 
and there are no words I could say to make you believe 
that I did this for us 
Now I'm back on the mission 
tryna get what's mine 
I gotta have her but this nigga here's in my way 
What he don't know 
from a 1 to 10 that girls a dime 
No disrespect but when I met her dawg she was a foe
I taught her everything she know 

I remember when 
we were lovers and friends 
friends till the end 
But now you're back again 
cause you see me with him 
And it's funny how you think
Funny how the tables turned, 
played your cards now watch it burn karma cuts so deep
It starts to burn
Now what you really sorry for? 
I lost track of keeping score
Sick of all the back and forth
So now I gotta know for sure 
yeahhh

Do you love me? Tell me that you love me
That's all I wanted to hear
Do you love me? Tell me that you love me
I'll make it all disappear 
Do you love me? Tell me that you love me 
Say that you love me
Say that you love me
Say that you love me babbbby

Baby honestly this is so hard for me
Cause yours I wanna be 
Yeah
Yeah he treats me right
But you make love to my mind
You be my permanent high 

Funny how the tables turned, played your cards now watch it burn 
Karma cuts so deep
It starts to burn
Now what you really sorry for? 
I lost track of keeping score
Sick of all the back and forth
So now I gotta know for sure yeahhh

Do you love me? Tell me that you love me
That's all I wanted to hear
Do you love me? Tell me that you love me
I'll make it all disappear 
Do you love me? Tell me that you love me 
Say that you love me
Say that you love me
Say that you love me 

I fucked up, I ain't gon' lie
Tryna get a piece of that apple pie
I fucked up, I ain't gon' lie 
Finally got a piece of that apple pie 
Hey
I hit the road, came back home
Note on the table sayin she was gone
Tears spin the words
Sayin I can't wait 
Found somebody else hope it's not too late

Do you love me? Tell me that you love me
That's all I wanted to hear
Do you love me? Tell me that you love me
I'll make it all disappear 
Do you love me? Tell me that you love me 
Say that you love me (say it baby)
Say that you love me (say it baby)
Say that you love me
