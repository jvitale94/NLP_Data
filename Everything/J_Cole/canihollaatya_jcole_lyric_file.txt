Never forget the day I met you
We was destined for each other like a,
Son to his mother or a sister and brother, man this bond is deep
We go a couple years and don’t even speak, but know it’s love though
Could never let em’ dirty your name I got the utmost respect for you,
Came back home and had to check for you,
Word 'round town is you locked down
Some older niggas snatched you up gave you a rock now
Damn, hey could it be, she like “if you was me you wouldn’t wait for me
Living fast you wouldn’t mash the brakes for me”
Big city slicker nigga on a higher track
Bigger now but when she send a letter always write her back
And time revealed, she feels that she settled too soon
While she see me go for mines and she admire that
We speak about time as if we could just buy it back
If only it was that simple, damn I miss you


Can I holla at you,
Can I holla at you,
Lemme holla at you,
Yeah I know its been a while, but ain’t no better time than now
Can I holla at you,
Can I holla at you,
Ay, let me holla at you
Yeah I know its been a while, but


You betrayed me,
The day you played my momma you played me
Can’t believe I let you in my heart nigga
I should’ve, followed my instincts a stranger in my house
Only five years old but sensed danger in my house
I was too young too scrap you but damn if I ain’t want to
I'm blowing up fast and I hope these words haunt you
Uh, thirteen years knew you more then my real pops
Put me on to ‘Pac, and all the rappers that killed cops
Who would’ve thought you’d leave my momma high and dry
Last words to a bitch nigga “why you lie?”
Feeling bitter so these words might seem jumbled
When you left I watched that lady crumble
I know by now you probably a old man,
But I still I feel I won’t be satisfied until we throw hands
For all the ass whoppin's
Heard you tryna’ talk to, tell that punk don’t call me
You ain’t shit and I’m scared it rubbed off on me




I heard you on that shit I hope it ain’t true
Was hard to holla at you last time I came through
Could barely recognize you, naw nigga this ain’t you
Cause you ain’t lookin’ like that nigga that I once knew
And plus you act like you don’t know me
We was homies, now you call me by my rap name
See me do my thing, so you expecting me to act strange
Ain't holla'ed but you on my mind nigga
I dont forget the good times nigga
White tee’s in the club, jeans baggy as fuck
Sometimes I look back on my life, that was the happiest stuff
You had potential to be monumental, ville mentality
You know that old kill or be killed mentality
I look at where you at now it’s a, real fatality
Cause where you supposed to be is on top, close to me
Chasin’ hoes like the old days,
But now we overseas, dawg
Congratulations on your seat
Yo my nigga can I holla at you?
