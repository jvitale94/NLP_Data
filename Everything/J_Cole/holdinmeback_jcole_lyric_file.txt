What's joy without no pain
And I'm still gon do my thing
There ain't no holding me back
Hey I'm gon get mine believe that
And what's sunshine with no rain
And what's Joy without no pain
Hey yeah
Yeah hey


The city fucked up even thug niggas getting robbed.
Know it's bad when the drug dealers getting jobs
Same niggas who skipped out on graduation
At the gas station filling out the applications but
They ain't calling me back
Best friends be our references
Pay checks spent on necklaces
Down payments on the Lexuses
Debit in the negative
Overdraft with the sky overcast
But I'm screaming fuck the pessimist
Cause there ain't no holding me back, huh
The little nigga had big dreams to do big things
But in this thing everything ain't what this shit seems
Trying hard to come up in the flag pole just to
Find out your heroes is some assholes
But there ain't no hlding me back
