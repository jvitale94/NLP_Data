I betca' wonderin' how I knew
That you been tryin' to infiltrate my crew
It ain't no hidin' from the Flava U
Don't get it confused, you ain't untouchable

An' while I been tryin' to keep my cool like a queen
Without them bringin' the naughty girl outta me

Don't cha know I heard you tryin' to take mine?
While I shine, you're livin' fake lives
Don't ya know I heard you tryin' to take mine?
But while I shine ya lip an' fake y'all styles

All around me hata's tryin' to play La'
But they know that they can't take her paper

Go 'head an' do it

Everybody talkin', see
Spreadin' them lies about my friends an' me
They say that we're tight than suppose to get
That's because I haven't let ya chill wit me yet

You make it hard for a girl to roll
But make it easy, so my pockets stay swol'

Don't cha know I heard you tryin' to take mine?
While I shine, you're livin' fake lives
Don't ya know I heard you tryin' to take mine?
But while I shine ya lip an' fake y'all styles

All around me hata's tryin' to play La'
But they know that they can't take her paper

Where my fellas at? Where my fellas at?
Where my ladies at? Where my ladies at?

As I look back on my life
To get where I am, I had to sacrifice
You slammed on my name in your magazine
This business gets hard tryin' to stay a queen

You're checkin' for me, you need to check yourself
An' be someone, not someone else

Don't cha know I heard you tryin' to take mine?
While I shine, you're livin' fake lives
Don't ya know I heard you tryin' to take mine?
But while I shine ya lip an' fake y'all styles

All around me hata's tryin' to play La'
But they know that they can't take her paper

Flava Unit, that's right
Refugee Camp All-Stars

Go 'head an' do it
Go 'head an' do it

Why they wanna stick me from behind?
Why they? Why they? Why they? Why they?
Why they wanna stick me from behind?
Check it

Why they wanna stick me from behind?
Check it, check it
Why they wanna stick me from behind?
Yo, damn, damn

Why they wanna stick me from behind?
Right, right, Refugee All-Stars 'til infinity
