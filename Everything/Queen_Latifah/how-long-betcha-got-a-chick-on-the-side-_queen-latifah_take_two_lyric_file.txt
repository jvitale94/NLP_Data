Betcha got a chick on the side, sure you got a chick
I know you got a chick on the side
I know you got a chick on the side
I know you got a chick on the side
I know you got a chick on the side

I know you want us both and I know the reason why.
I can give you so much lovin ,
But presents, she can buy you.
Last night youre in my arms,
Tonight Im all alone

[Chorus:]
How long will this game go on? How long?
Oh, oh how long?

Betcha got a chick on the side, sure you got a chick.
I know you got a chick on the side.

And its plain, plain enough to see that
Youre not the man for me.
I cant keep playin games that keep my heart in pain.
I want to turn and walk away but its harder to do
Than it is to say.

[Chorus]

It might hurt me for awhile but of one thing I am sure.
Ill get over you, yes Ill find someone new.
Each time I open up my heart,
It seems to just get torn apart.

[Adlib line 1:]
I saw you, dont you try to hide.
Dont hide it from me, no, no. no.

[Adlib line 2:]
You thought you would hide it, hide it,
Hide it from me.
[Repeat...]
