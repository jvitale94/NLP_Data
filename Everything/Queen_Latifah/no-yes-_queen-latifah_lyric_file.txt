It's been too long since you kissed me
Do you want me or is you gonna leave it alone
I'm so tired of this driving
Throw my head, I will see you

No, yes, you gonna see me
No, yes, you gonna see me
No, yes, you gonna see me
No, yes, you gonna see me

If it's real nada see the truth
The reality is real recognize

No, yes, you gonna see me
No, yes, you gonna see me
No, yes, you gonna see me
No, yes, you gonna see me
