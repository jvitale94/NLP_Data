Weekend love
Caught up in a weekend love
Weekend love
Just a case of weekend love

If you been mislead
By anything I've said
Didn't mean to turn you on
The bite is oh so strong

And you got things to do
When I have got things too
So I'll catch you on the weekend
Monday to Fridays, I don't see you then

A W E E K and a E N D
And L O V E we were meant to be
A W E E K, a E N D
L O V E we were meant to be

Weekend love
Caught up in a weekend love
Weekend love
Just a case of weekend love

Seems it's been so long
Since you thrilled me with your charms
I tenderly imagine me
Resting in your arms

You've got things to do
When I have got things too
So I'll catch you on the weekend
Monday to Fridays, I don't see you then

Because we're sorry when we part
And we love when we meet
I know we only do that
For once in a week

Sorry when we part
And we love when we meet
I know we only do that
Listen once in a week

I know, you know
We all occupied
From our own love life
Things has been denied

Many feelings high
Many tears, I've cried
But on the weekend
That must be rectified

Weekend love
Caught up in a weekend love
Weekend love
Just a case of weekend love

If you've been mislead
By anything I've said
Didn't mean to turn you on
The bite was, oh so strong

You've got things to do
But I have got things too
So I'll catch you on the weekend
Monday to Fridays, I don't see you then

A W E E K and a E N D
L O V E we were meant to be
A W E E K, a E N D
L O V E we were meant to be

When we are absent that is a pleasant present
To nourish and cherish every moment
To deliver the goods, I am efficient
And I know, you're possessed with the ingredients

Durin' the weekend the days seems to be long
But by the weekend I wish the clock would reverse it's time
Great things can come in a small bag
So let's make use of the time that we have

When we are together 'cos we stay popular
[Incomprehensible]
When we are together and you and I wonder
If this love is gonna last forever

Well, then I think
And I start remember
That we are understand

Weekend love
Caught up in a weekend love
Weekend love
Just a case of weekend love
