Queen Latifah
Miscellaneous
Fly Girl (Brixton Bass Mix)
Well it's almost nightfall 
and there's no forecast of rainfall 
and I'm in the mood for a party 
so I'm gonna go out to a club 
and give the dancefloor body 
so I jump in the car and go to the venue 
walk in the door and now I'm on the menu 
guys in the house they're wacthing me 
they're clocking me there's no stopping me 

(refrain) 
(desire) I know you want me 
(you're fine) thank you 
but I'm not the type of girl that you think I am 
I don't jump into the arms of every man 
(but I'm paid) I don't need your money 
(I love you) you must be mad 
easy lover is something that I ain't 
besides, I don't know you from a can of paint 

tell me why is it when I walk past the guys 
I always hear, yo, baby? 
I mean like what's the big idea? 
I'm a queen, nuff respect 
treat me like a lady 
and, no, my name ain't yo and I ain't got your baby 
I'm looking for a guy who's sincere 
one with class and savoir faire 
I'm looking for someone who has to be 
perfect for the queen latifah me 

(fly girl, fly girl) 
(come here, cuz you're sexy and you're fine) 
(and I want you to be mine) 
(fly girl, fly girl) 
(have no fear, your heart is in good hands) 
(won't you let me be your man?) 

all my friends are in relationships 
some of then good ones and some of them bad ones 
some of the bad ones took a turn for the better 
and some of the good ones ended up sad ones 
you see? loving, it ain't hard to get 
I want a friend not just a lover 
someone who is dedicated only to me 
not to me and two or three others 
one who will not lie to me or think 
he can get my love by buying me 
I know I'll find him some day 
and when I find him 
he sure won't say 

(repeat refrain) 

(fly girl, fly girl 
(come here, cuz you're sexy and you're fine) 
(and i want you to be mine) 
(fly girl, fly girl, have no fear) 
(have no fear, your heart is in good hands) 
(won't you let me be your man?) 

lounging, sitting in the house 
and I'm cooling, first day of the week 
so there's nothing to do 
and I'm in the mood for a real soft kiss 
momma never said there'll be days like this 
so I called her and we talked for a while 
hang up the phone feeling better 
with a smile 

it's cool, cuz 91 is my year 
and this time I know Iâ€™m gonna hear 

(fly girl, fly girl, come here) 
(come here, cuz you're sexy and you're fine) 
(and I want you to be mine) 
(fly girl, fly girl) 
(have no fear, your heart is in good hands) 
(won't you let me be your man?) 

(repeat refrain)
