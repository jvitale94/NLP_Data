

Ah shit, what the fuck?
Are you serious?
Hit the motherfuckin' floor, baby!
Let's go!
Uh, uh, uh, YEAH!
Uh, uh, uh, YEAH!
Uh, uh, uh, YEAH!
Let's go!


Y'all lookin' for names, I'm lookin' for beats
Y'all lookin' for fame, I live in the streets
Y'all talk the talk, but I walk the walk
School street, home of the brave, NEW YORK
Y'all make movies, but I make moves
Straight up, y'all got somethin' to prove
Y'all niggaz duck, but I swing back
Y'all niggaz run, but I bring gats
Y'all niggaz whisper, "X is a crackhead"
Aight fuck it, I'ma just crack heads
I bang niggaz that cross the line
Y'all niggaz talk shit from way behind
I stand my ground, but y'all niggaz don't
Shit I go to jail, but y'all niggaz won't
Y'all niggaz walk around and get scared
But I don't give a fuck, I don't care


I ain't a dancing nigga, I just move to the beat
Sit there and nod my head but won't move my feet
Gangsta, so I'm holdin' up the walk
That dancing shit up to the rest of y'all



Y'all niggaz is pussy, straight up ass
I keep that thing, and I'll blast
letcha man know, he don't wanna push me
Remember, it's you not me that's pussy
Y'all niggaz walk light on your toes
I come through hard, kickin' down doors
I spit a mean 16 without a pause
Then let 16 go just because
You in it for the dough, I'm in it for life
You in jail beatin' your dick, I'm fuckin' your wife
I bring the drama, I bring the noise
Kidnap yo mama, bring her to the boys
I make shit happen with one word
You take shit laughin' nigga, you's a bird
I take niggaz for everything they got
That's why I'm the dog and you not
