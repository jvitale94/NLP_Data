That means y'all, but when you get caught up don't even call
Don't worry about me 'cause I'm gonna ball


Cal' city ridin' half way through and they like
Not know me ye but I'll do it
Just last week wasn't really nothing to it
Catch slim shit, wish I'd do it
Know what it is, same old rappers is like
Watch the movie now the whole story happens
Check it, you do you I do me
The Dog gon' be alright you'll see
I've been down this road before I'm sure
This is the battlefield and I'm built for war
Ain't nothing new to an OG
Bullshit each other hard time they all know me
Getting there, the dick riders, the insiders
But the ones that we let get in ridin' beside us
Keep your friends close, enemies closer
I got it, I put 'em all in one pocket


If I can't fuck with you for real I can't fuck with you at all
That means y'all, but when you get caught up don't even call
Don't worry about me 'cause I'm gonna ball


I wish I could believe, I wanna count on you
Never get to worry about me, whether on you
Have to make it to the bottom of the sea when it was for
You took the snake, you made me trust all
I trust you to stab me in the back
Trust you to stuck one in your mouth
Soon as I walk out
Trust you to steal from me like greedy
Acting like we love each other why do me
Everything about you is crooked, look it
Fed a nigga some bullshit, I took it
That's what I get all for fucking with a hybrid
Most of you talk about the sides
Fool me once, shame on you
Fool me twice, did what you supposed to do
Ain't never even thought about biting the hand that feeds me
Good job motherfucker, it's greedy


If I can't fuck with you for real I can't fuck with you at all
That means y'all, but when you get caught up don't even call
Don't worry about me 'cause I'm gonna ball
