Do it every time man 
Every time man 
Every time they do it to me 

Yess 
Yess 
Yess 

 
I gotta make it out, or move quickly 
Can't allow the past to restrict me 
Bet this time around they won't skip me 
I am the last hope (The Champ!) 
Won't hesitate not even for a second 
The hustle has become an obsession 
I'm on the frontlines with my weapon 
I am the last hope 

 
Damn, I went through it again 
After telling everybody I wouldn't do it again 
I kinda feel like I let my people down (yup) 
But to get them right, I got's to pick myself up (come on) 
When I heard this beat and hook, it was so raw (uhh) 
Looked in the mirror, didn't like what I saw, (uhh) 
All I could say was: ahh man shit gotta change (forreal!) 
Even get it right and take one to the brain (blam!) 
But y'all knew the pain that I went through daily, (woooh) 
Tryna stay sane through the rain, y'all hear me 
I'm slippin', fallin', I can't get up 
But this time I'm outta control, I don't give a fuck! 
But for the thugs!, I'm the last hope for the team (come on!) 
I'm the reason why some niggas, gotta hole in a dream (come on!) 
These cats know what's good, I am the hood (Aii) 
I ain't hoping that they don't, I wish a nigga would (come on!) 
I gotta make it out, or move quickly 
Can't allow the past to restrict me 
Bet this time around they won't skip me 
I am the last hope (The Champ!) 
Won't hesitate not even for a second 
The hustle has become an obsession 
I'm on the frontlines with my weapon 
I am the last hope 

 
I gots to do it for me, do it for them, (yeah) 
I ain't playing with this shit, I'ma do it to win 
Know I can do it again, (come on) cause I did it before 
With little to no effort, and y'all niggas knew the score (for real) 
First album dropped in may, the second in december 
Over platinum in one year like, y'all don't remember, (come on) 
Only nigga who's first 5 albums debut at number 1 
And you wonder why I call you son (my son) 
I just begun, to get started, but the hardest part of it all 
Is to climb a slippery wall and, still don't fall 
Break down and call up to God, when it get to hard 
I know you ain't gonn' let me go now! (please) brought me too far 
Showed me I was as a star, all my life 
I know it, all it right, before I, call it a night 
I'mma thank you for it all, the blessings and the curses 
And I hope you listening, there's a lesson in the verses 
Yeah 

 
I gotta make it out, or move quickly 
Can't allow the past to restrict me 
Bet this time around they won't skip me 
I am the last hope (The Champ!) 
Won't hesitate not even for a second 
The hustle has become an obsession 
I'm on the frontlines with my weapon 
I am the last hope 

 
Does it bother me? 
Yeah of course it bothers me 
That's not who I am, I'm not you know, the person the media portrays me to 
Be, ya mean?
