(You can't push us around!)
You can't push us around
(You can't push us around!)
You can't push us around
(You can't push us around!)
If you try, gonna lie
6 feet underground


Papa's in the closet, loading up that buckshot
Little sister hide behind the grandfather clock
I've seen that old blood money get washed
I watched the shotgun shell go pop
Got a couple rounds in the Chevy ashtray
I don't know why I was made this way
Sec-your-ity don't want it with me
If we can't get in, the fuck you say?
Too much billy is in this cup
Too many people are in this club
You keep looking at me like you want to jump
If we let loose homie, you won't get up




Little brother raised on the front yard gym
He only thinks, Jim's too quick
Stands 5 2, nickname Slim
Motherfucker thinks he's 6 foot 10
Never seen a young man act so rough
Never see a frown take you've seen that drown
Put another pit back in his cup
You know it's a fucking party when he comes to town
Yeah, I know a little something about getting high
Yeah, I know a little something about getting drunk
You fuck with the Wolfpack and everybody rise
So go jump in the pen and if you feeling lucky punk (hah)




I don't know what's wrong with me lately
I don't really feel like myself
Everybody's reaching for money
Sorry that I can't help
It's like I throw you a bone
But if you were my dog, I wouldn't throw you a bone
I'd throw you a log
With, both of my knees
Both of my knees, on the ground
(I'm dropping famous shit)
People that are close to me know that I got damn
Too famous quick
Row with the boat, 
With the bottle, I'm a heinous kid
Jump, when I say, jump
You've got to jump from the cliff
(You've gotta say you will)
Stand up with team
Stand up on the ball!
Like a fucking animal
Eat, if I got to eat
I'm a eat you alive!
I said eat, if I got to eat
I'm a eat you alive
Yeah I know I said that twice
And don't make me say it again motherfucker!
