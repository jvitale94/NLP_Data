They wanna know what I’ve been through and what dirt I’ve done
But man if I told you what I’ve seen and been through,
Then you’d probably run off
You’re scared of the truth, so it’s dead in secret lined in chalk
See I’ve been lost ever since I could walk
Lookin’ for my daddy in any one of mama’s boyfriend who would talk
Or listened to me when I spoke instead of looking at me like a joke
Or leavin’ me behind, leavin’ me to cry when you treated my mama like a ho’
But I learned quick that my daddy wasn’t never gonna come around
And I didn’t give a shit cause me and my mama we held it down
No new kicks, first day of school I’m good will bound
But when you come from the trench that’s how you learned to walk around
So I don’t give a fuck if you ever lay eyes on top of my new shoes homie
I just wanted you to know that I didn’t need a dollar from you I got ‘em myself
So if you find yourself in the middle of the floor,
With a bottle, drinking yourself lonely
Then you can keep company with a picture of me in a magazine on the shelf
Turn the page...


Daddy can you see me
I’m putting on a show
In the magazines
Hear me on the radio
So what’a you think?
Well I hope that you’re proud now
To watch it all go down
I’m sorry Daddy
You didn’t get to watch me grow
Now I’m always on the road
No time to say hello. Bye
And I hope that you’re proud now
To watch it all go down


Yeah Mamma you look great, perfect
Be safe on your first date, for certain
If he brings you home too late, I’ll hurt him
Don’t worry ‘bout me
I’m safe, I’ll close the curtains
And I feel like I’m raising you, but what do I know, Baby Blue
All I know is that I was made in you, so I put all my faith in you
Yea I was only 10, but I felt like a man and I had to let you go
All I wanted was for us to be rich, tear drops in my cereal bowl
So I turned into an asshole, young and dumb smokin’ weed
Vandalizing, robbing houses, stealing cars that was me
But everything I did I had to see, feel the pain had to grieve
To become who I am, and I’m proud of the man I came to be
Cause what I’ve learned, cannot be taught,
What I’ve earned could not be bought
Justified deserved it all so don’t be concerned, it’s not your fault
I never counted sheep, I count my blessings
So if you see him out Mamma, don’t give him the cold shoulder, give him my message
Just tell him...


Daddy can you see me

Now I’m always on the road
No time to say hello. Bye
And I hope that you’re proud now
To watch it all go down
