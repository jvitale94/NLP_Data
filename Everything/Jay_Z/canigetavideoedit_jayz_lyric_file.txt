Can I hit in the MORNING
without giving you half of my dough
And even worse if I was broke would you WANT ME?
If I couldn't get you finer things
like all of them diamond rings  KILL FOR
would you STILL ROLL?
If we couldn't see the sun risin off the shore of Thailand
would you RIDE THEN, if it wasn't DROPPIN?
If wasn't ah, eight figure  by the name of Jigga
would you come around naked, would you clown me?
If I couldn't flow futuristic would ya
put your two lips on my , kiss it - could ya
see yourself with a  workin harder than 9 to 5
contend with six, two jobs to survive, or
do you need a BALLA?  So you can shop and tear the MALL UP?
Brag, tell your friends what I BOUGHT YA
If you couldn't see yourself with a  when his dough is low
Baby girl, if this is so, yo..




Can I get a WHAT WHAT
to these chickens from all of my doves
who don't love those, they get no dough

Can I get a WOOP WOOP
