(The only race on the planet is the human one
Real talk
Spread love


We used to fight and fuss, we used to yell and cuss
We used to cock and bust now look at us
We done turned to ashes and dust to dust
I shoulda turned the cause and returned the love
I shoulda passed the bud to all the bloods
And leave them slugs with them pigs in the mud
Who the fuck turned 2Pac into a thug?
All I used to get was a pound and a hug
I remember when we used to hate them drugs
Now we can't rap without being fucked up
High in the club but you sound like a drunk
Hard in the street but a jailhouse punk
Me and that nigga, yeah we used to bring the funk
Now we got love and respect like a monk
Understand that we got a lot in common
Homie you in the same boat that I'm in


I'm calling all the real people, real people
Let em know that the change gon come
Tell me where the real people? Real people
It's time to wake up and stand as one
Calling all the real people, real people
You still got our faith nah we ain't none
Tell me where the real people out there
The real people out there


It's a good day when it's me and O'Shea
It's like the times we cheered for O.J
I say Mike, Cube say Kobe
But ain't no more beef, I put that on chief
Blaow, a little homie dead in the streets
It's like the day they compared us to meat
Glad Farrakan prepared us to meet
Now me and bro bringing meals to the meek
Think about my homie locked up like a Rasta
Dude in my ear asking me about the Oscars
I build with the gods to show improvement
Hard to complain, real people going through it
I know the movement like I was Huey Newton
Can't explain why youngin's are shooting
The revolution will not be on the ground
The revolution is who I am, God damn




I don't care what your color is
All my real people, real people love this, love this
I don't care what your color is
All my real people, real people love this, love this
I don't care what your color is
All my real people, real people love this, love this
I don't care what your color is
All my real people, real people love this, love this
Be the change
