C'mon, uh, uh, uh, yo, yo

 - Gotta man that I think I'm gon' love forever
And forever, we'll be together (C'mon)
No matter where he goes, I'll be thinkin' of him
I'm gonna love him, I'm gonna love him




Yo, Yo, this nigga lookin' like love, no doubt
Sophisticated thug keep me guessin'
Said it would be a blessin' just to watch you undressin'
Callin' you daddy, late nights I'm layin' on your chest
And, stay reminiscin' bout the rest
And, how they less than, trying to come between what we share
Can't compare, could have been left
But when it's mine, I never share, fight to the death
If need be to prove that, wounds from your war
Other bitches couldn't soothe that, broke from a bad back
I'm holdin' you down, throwin' dirt with other bitches
But them other fishes drown, locked in, for however long
I'm playin' it smart, court dates in other cities
There I'm playin√¢?T my part, wif-ey, in ya life see
Forever be us, passenger side of a Bentley
Or the number 2 bus, tell the whole world, papi
EVE don't want nobody else, with other niggas pick and choose
But you, I'm keepin' for myself




All my peoples thinkin' I'm delirious
But the love I feel is serious
Couples of the world, no comparing us
Been through fist fights with niggas when I see it escalate
I'm the getaway driver so my nigga can escape
Pull my ice for the bail, spending nights in jail
Drawing hearts on the wall with our names around the cell
It made a little craziness, maybe I'm blind
But for me to leave now lookin' for love would take a lifetime
So I'm keepin' mine, uh-huh, fuck it keep me blind
Feels like heaven when we makin' love, controllin' my spine
Wine and dine, I don't need that as long as long as you wit me
And you bitches thinkin' that you competition, come and get me
My position is held, some try and all fail
Pussy piece a mothafucka', uh-huh, good enough to sell
Never leave his baby girl, mad 'cause he claim me
Only thug in the hood that was wild enough to tame me




I'm the bitch he'll never leave, helped him build his luxuries
Carry stories that can hurt him, still he only trustin' me
Secrets never leave my mouth, even if they torture me
Always taught to hold the ground, that's why I'll always be his queen
It's some thug shit things see him in the party, start to flip
(What the fuck?)
Curse him out on the regular just to make him sick
Disappear for a day or two to test his loyal ground
Keep my dogs on a short leash, controllin' the growl
Open wide, I don't give a fuck, I'm swallowing my pride
And he fast to blast a cat that he think be on the prowl
But I'll never let him go, temper flare, let it go
Always be his extra back bone, quick to let a nigga know
Always by his side, EVE the apple in his eye
Us together ain't no stopping snatchin' pieces of the pie
Us together in our own world, what's his becomes mine
Exceed eternity with him we'll stand the test of time
