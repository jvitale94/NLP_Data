So my heart pumps icicles
No answer, I got no love
So my heart beats zero below
No answer, I got no love
So my heart pumps icicles
No answer, I got no love
So my heart beats zero below


Ayo, tell me why should I ever give a fuck
My time is money man and you ain't even worth a buck
Don't excuse the tone, this is how it is
Formin a cold blooded, and I don't give a shit
Got an announcement, the golden child comin
Straight killin em, boss bitch stuntin
These hoes crippled, not even in the runnin
Put out the feta so you know I ain't frontin
They had a little time, tried to be E V E
Snatchin the plate back, it's my turn to eat
And I'm a greedy bitch, man I don't like to share
Whole world mine, yea yea it ain't fair
They said I turned cold once I made my millions
I know you're mad, my success really hurt your feelings
No sugar coatin anything around here
Lioness, run team, who should rock here?


I got no answer, I got no love
So my heart pumps icicles
No answer, I got no love
So my heart beats zero below
'Cause I'm a cold motherfucker, I'm a cold...
She a cold motherfucker, I'm a cold m...
'Cause I'm a cold motherfucker, I'm a cold...
I'm a cold motherfucker, I'm a cold...
I got no answer, I got no love
So my heart pumps icicles
No answer, I got no love
So my heart beats zero below


Isabelle Marant, bottles blood stained
From all these wannabees that thought they was better than me
Got em thirsty for it, give this bitch a drink
Iceberg dead ahead, I make Titanic sink
I'm just what they not, they must really all you got
You could never take my spot
Trust me, you don't wanna pop
Yea, I shoot, when shockin all reason that yo mouth drop
Fuck you 'cause you're at the bottom, love me 'cause I'm on top
I'm a fashionista, cannibal â€“ I eat ya
History I teach ya anywhere I meat ya
Still tryna get a gig, baby I'm the feature
If you wanna wear my crown dig a little deeper
Hah, you ain't even in my league
Murder murder, I'm a kill em on this beat
Got em shook now, getting dirty lips now
Still you shine, guess I'm a cook now


I got no answer, I got no love
So my heart pumps icicles
No answer, I got no love
So my heart beats zero below
'Cause I'm a cold motherfucker, I'm a cold...
She a cold motherfucker, I'm a cold m...
'Cause I'm a cold motherfucker, I'm a cold...
I'm a cold motherfucker, I'm a cold...
I got no answer, I got no love
