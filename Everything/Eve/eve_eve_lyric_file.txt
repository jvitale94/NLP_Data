Step Back, Where She At, Man I’m In My Zone
If You Can’t Keep Up With Where I’m At,
Then Take Your Ass Back Home
Raise The Flag And Tell The People Come,
The Queen Is On The Throne
Watch How They Leave You Standing There,
Just Leave You All Alone
You Were Grown Up Watching People Go And Get Your Own
Matter Of Fact, I Don’t Give A Fuck, You Guessed That From My Tone
I’m A Philly Born, Bred, Raised, Never Left My Bones
I’m A Bossy, Glossy Rebel, Nobel Woh My Name Is Long


Ain’t No Guessing It’s E-V-E
I’m The Chick That They Wish They’d Be
Know By Now, Do Not Fuck With Me
Stay On Top, No Touching Me
I’m The Reason You Wanna Hide
Swallow Your Face, Spit In Your Eyes
Better Than Ever, Ain’t No Surprise
See On Me, Need No Disguise
I’m E-V-E
E-E-V-E
E-E-V-E
E-E-V-E
Ain’t No Guessing It’s E-V-E
I’m The Chick That They Wish They’d Be
Know By Now, Do Not Fuck With Me
Stay On Top, No Touching Me
Ain’t No Guessing It’s E-V-E
I’m The Chick That They Wish They’d Be
Know By Now, Do Not Fuck With Me
Stay On Top, No Touching Me

Uh, Yo, You See How They Need Her
They Was Loyal, They Keep Her
All My Friends You The Best
Feel My Love Through The Speaker
You The Reason I Do It, I’m So Lucky I Can
And Taking Over The World, Now That’s Just Part Of The Plan
They See Me Riding In A Mad Black Drop It Look At That
Time For Shades On, Understand That I’m It, That’s That
Rock Like Jet Set, Drop Aboard, I’m Living Good
Yeah I Knew I Would, I Know You Wish You Could
