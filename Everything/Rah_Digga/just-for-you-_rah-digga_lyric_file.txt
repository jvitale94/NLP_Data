All my niggas y'all, Flipmode y'all
Flipmode y'all, hardcore y'all, raw shit y'all
Hardcore y'all, Flipmode y'all

All my bitches y'all, all my bitches y'all
Flipmode y'all, Flipmode y'all
Hardcore y'all, raw shit y'all
Hardcore y'all, Flipmode y'all

Never judge a nigga like the cover of a book
Fuck around and get shot back of the foot
Nigga, fall, stumble and look, nervous and shook
Dragged in the alley and book and beat down to a pulp

Shot up my cops, Dirty Harry
You stickin' me is like niggas fuckin' the Virgin Mary
Shit we carry will have you found layin' down
Somewhere damp and muddy, split your tummy
Puncture your kidney and make you piss bloody

So now I leave your body to rot
Where bitches sell they pussy for rock
Cook they coke in steamin' water, boil in a pot
Do you know niggas like us that clutter they watch
Invest in yo' block, like it or not, involvin' your pops?

You messin' wit a rhyme surgeon
Trade the GS for the excursion, heads is turnin'
Flipmode we still mergin'
Now we splurgin' in suburbans
Dirty Harriet rock the camouflage turbans

Said one for the money and two for mic check
And spit a million rhymin' words in 240 seconds
Get three to get your bitch neck and four to even the score
Graveyard shifter mister, y'all believe in the law

Flipmode like Mary Lou Retton
Suede ballet shoes steppin', do the best that I can can
Like Pointer sisters, who could join the wizard?
Talkin' outta place, I pick the knife up and cut the tongue
Right outta your mouth and fuck your life up

This for my niggas, y'all come get wit us
More raw hardcore shit just for you, you, you, you
This for my sistas, we know y'all miss us
Flipmode got raw shit just for you, you, you, you

Before all the plaques and the Source Aawards
Y'all niggas wanna dick ride, so jump aboard
It's a first class ass whippin', rampage, I ain't trippin'
Check all the magazine clippin's

Yo, I pluck pigeons, get brains in expeditions
Cause friction, every chick I stick my dick in
I'm not trustworthy, like midnight, I'm pickin'
Spliff keep it warm like wool caps to mittens

Watch for me in a new milli, kick up dust with my shoe shitty
New Jack City, wicked ways move wit me
Holla mine, in these violent times crooks bear malice
White collar crime, Columbine, we clear classes

Burn a nigga into ashes, how I mash his ass like Cassius
Finger jabs, I got it mastered, fantastic
Writin' half ass shit, splash kids
Poke â€~em with the bassinet in the neck, graphic

Can't tell I'm from QB the way that I talk
Speakin' in tongue with six blocks callin' my dun
Bogie collapsed lung, big and small gats we brung
Bangin' your drums with hot shit and more to come

But then we manifest the truth
The niggas fight predictions from The Bible
Betrayal for niggas is suicidal
Kick swift shit niggas rock harder than Limp Bizkit
Dirty Harriet floodin' all through your district

This for my niggas, y'all come get wit us
More raw hardcore shit just for you, you, you, you
This for my sistas, we know y'all miss us
Flipmode got raw shit just for you, you, you, you

This for my niggas, y'all come get wit us
More raw hardcore shit just for you, you, you, you
This for my sistas, we know y'all miss us
Flipmode got raw shit just for you, you, you, you
