My uncle Wayne was a kingpin, you know what I'm saying
My uncle Don, that nigga used to rob banks and shit, rest in peace
My granddaddy was a boss, he was a king pin you hear me

Got the game from them old niggas
You gotta know where I'm from to get to know a nigga
I'm still glad I smoke weed
Hidin' from the police
I spent time overseas, hanging out in England
And I got the squad on my mind and I mean this
Do a little time out the country, I need this
56 nights, gotta know the real meaning

Dropped Monster tape and had to go to Europe
Best thing I ever did was fall out of love
Esco came to me, he said they think you washed up
You need to go back in, show these niggas who the one
We going back in as soon as we get off tour
He had my hard drive on him when he caught the case
When they took him in custody they took my life away

People didn't even understand that my hard drives that I recorded all my music on for two years straight was on this... was on this one hard drive that Esco had and he was locked up with it, so I had to record new music. That's when I did Beast Mode

I'm fresh off the plane on them Zaytiggy's
I endured so much pain, ain't got Esco with me
Ain't got nobody smoke one or pour with me
Niggas rocked the lean, man, when I was OT
And I'm still dealing with the time they gave Doe B
How you gon' get your armed robbery around me?
And my lifestyle getting way bigger
I got so much love for my niggas
Brown paper bag we getting back to the paper
Getting back to the basics
Everything I did, it was premeditated
I just knew there'd come a time when I finally did make it
And some niggas started hating, I ain't never had no problem with these niggas
I've been about my guala from the dodo
Got an R&B chick laying on me, no photo
Got a combo in the condo doing some real life porno

And I ain't worried about nothing in the world, keep that badass bitch
These niggas ain't on my problems, damn that shit
There's so much more I gotta endure
I just had my baby gotta go on tour

Got the game from them old niggas
You gotta know where I'm from to get to know a nigga
I'm still glad I smoke weed
Hidin' from the police
I spent time overseas, hanging out in England
And I got the squad on my mind and I mean this
Do a little time out the country, I need this
56 nights, gotta know the real meaning

I ain't holding this back, I ain't holding this
The music way ahead of its time and I notice this
Get back in the studio, give them what they was missing
They didn't know I knew the game and I know how to reinvent it
They ain't know me in the projects, they just know me from rhyming
My hard work finally catching up with perfect timing

You know what I'm saying, I could take a hundred dollar slab and goddamn make three hundred off that bitch, you dig?

Got the game from them old niggas
You gotta know where I'm from to get to know a nigga
I'm still glad I smoke weed
Hidin' from the police
I spent time overseas, hanging out in England
And I got the squad on my mind and I mean this
Do a little time out the country, I need this
56 nights, gotta know the real meaning

Everything in the streets, it prepared me for everything that I'm going through right now. The good and the bad, you know what I'm saying? Can't let none of this shit get to me. I go harder cause I know where I was at, and I know where I wanna go
