Metro Boomin want some more nigga

All my niggas some junkies, they keep that bread on 'em dawg
Yo lil ho is a monkey, she got a head on her, dawg
Caught a flight outta London, I can't see nothin' but stars
It don't fuck with my conscious I serve my auntie that raw
Fell asleep at the gamblin' house with that heater right on me
And I got me some stripes like I keep Adidas on me
And I don't believe hype, all my soda get spiked
I shake the Codeine and Sprite cause that's just the way of life


I'm a monster on these hoes, I'mma monster
I can't be scared of none you niggas, ya'll some snitches
I got some girls that claim they straight but now they kissin'
These bitches switchin', tryna get my dick a hickey
I'm a monster on these hoes, I'mma monster
I can't be scared of none you niggas, ya'll some snitches
I got some girls that claim they straight but now they kissin'
These bitches switchin', tryna get my dick a hickey
And I say fuck all the rules, I'd rather fuck your baby momma
And I say bring all your tools cause I'm ready for that drama
And I know I'm a young gunner ain't worried about karma
And I'm just livin' my life and I'mma get me some money

I'm young Freddie Kruger, I promote prostitution
These niggas come up snoozin' cause they ladies out here choosin'
I know your dog hoes back in style
These hoes'll smash up on your niggas and be very proud
Wow
I don't be trustin' these hoes, I just be smashin' these hoes
I'm gone pull up on these hoes
Young nigga trappin out the ghost
Choppin' like Kung Fu
Used to wanna fuck 2 now I wanna fuck the crew
Got bad bitches in the rear
Me and young Metro trappin out lear
The fresh new gear made a bitch disappear
A fresh pack of mollies make the bitch go to work
The lean in the kush make the pussy squirt
Motherfucker thought she came home from church
Some real good make a nigga call back
Chasin' that cheese yeen ain't nothin' but a rat
Free band gang, nigga pull up on a flex
Bitch got knocked, naw bitch got whacked
I'm talkin bout murkin' that pussy like blaat!



I don't be trustin' these hoes, I just be smashin' these hoes
I don't be trustin' these hoes, I just be smashin' these hoes
I don't be trustin' these hoes, I just be smashin' these hoes
I don't be trustin' these hoes, I just be smashin' these hoes
I'm gon' pull up on these hoes
Young nigga told me not to ghost
