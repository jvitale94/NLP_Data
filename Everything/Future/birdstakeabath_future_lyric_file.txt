Birds take a bath
And then they come out clean
Birds take a bath
Watch it come out green
Let Them Birds take a bath (splash)
And if it come out clean
Birds take a bath
Watch it come out green
Let the Birds take a bath

If the birds stay clean
They come out Charlie Sheen (winning)
They come out coop machines
They shoulda came with wings
How they flying in
Man I'm on that lean
In the house with green
In the house with yay
Man we need a mask
All these dope fumes (Don't sniff)
While we count this cash
Straight drop class
Put it in a freezer
Put it on a block
Give them J's a teaser
They gave my dope a name
They call this dope diesel
You need some gambino
You be fly like a eagle
We move them bands like cheetah
Get you a egg beater
And a half a square
Whip you a brick fair


Let them Birds take a bath
And then they come out clean
Let them Birds take a bath
Watch it come out green
Let them Birds take a bath
And if it come out clean
Let them Birds take a bath
Watch it come out green
Let them Birds take a bath

I mean some birds in the shower dawg
Pass me the bounty dawg
Quick picker upper
Look at this motherfucker
His rhyme is a paper plate
I chop 'em like paper stakes
My life is a marathon
Cause I'm on the paper chase
My dog caught a paper case
He had too much paper on him
He said it was routine
I said they was waiting on him
Them fed they just chase the sack
Them J they just taste the crack
These dumb niggas chasing hoes
And me I'm chasing racks
Catch me off a fifty sacks
Fuck up bout thirty racks
Go drop me twelve bars
And get that there right back
My aunty say what's that smell
She said it is smellin' sour
I find it hard to believe
I just got 'em out the shower


Birds take a bath
And then they come out clean
Birds take a bath
Watch it come out green
Birds take a bath
And if it come out clean
Birds take a bath
Watch it come out green
Birds take a bath

I just wash the birds off
Cut both my phones off
You know how I clean em up
Got falcons and eagles nigga
A stash house with bands in it
Cook out in six kitchens
You know I got birds nigga
I get them for zero
Clean them with remix
The bird bought me everything
The bird bought me diamond chain
Got bricks call em bird man
Just me the cash money
Like Nipsey a marathon
Yeah I'm on jigga thon
I can't stop counting up
Them birds come every day
Plus I see them everywhere
Just send me a stork nigga
Get him the next day
Birds take a bath
I put a ride on the express way


Birds take a bath
And then they come out clean
Birds take a bath
Watch it come out green
Birds take a bath
And if it come out clean
Birds take a bath
Watch it come out green
Birds take a bath
