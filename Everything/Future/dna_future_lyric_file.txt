I be trappin, getting that cake, it's in my dna
Had that skeeted in the face, you caught my dna
Got a bitch in every state, it's in my dna
It's in my dna, I'm stacking paper every day
It's in my dna
Hey, hey, it's my dna,
I just pour me up ace, it's in my dna

I feel like tarzan and king kong, your v on my 3phone
No iPhone that 5d, and 4d, on 2g, on 2 street,
I'm 3d, I'm hd, these movies that I make
Can't see me, you capische
I'm a titan, I fly in, like a pelican,
You irrelevant, to a president, on medicine
It's that kilo, the fuck ding tones, young chapo
Young future fucking on pocket holes
We ree up then reload, I blow up, then explode
I'm organized like a crime boss, I'm up there like a mafia
That's a fresh new... I'm jaded up like a raster
Got a million zones I'm a raster
No chains on I'm aqua, fina, water,
I slaughter your daughters, I'm known in ben harbor


I'm a star, cold bald barillas in my dna
I be trappin, getting that cake, it's in my dna
Had that skeeted in the face, you caught my dna
Got a bitch in every state, it's in my dna
It's in my dna, I'm stacking paper every day
It's in my dna
Hey, hey, it's my dna,
I just pour me up ace, it's in my dna

I'm sucker free dog, pass me my sprite
I'm atl and to say I'm way way out of sight
Light that baby buzz syrup, man that's shaking me on point
I was serving fyrup, tryina make my rent first of the month
And I got your girl, and I filled her mouth a lot of cum
I'm rolling big blunts, lots of killer ganja down my lungs
Hard times turn me to a maniac,
My blood line, motion pictures cinematic
Mix it up, mix it up, mix it up
Pour it up, pour it up, pour it up
Stereophone, cellphone, baking soda, I'm screwed up
Lil flip, game over!


I'm a star, cold bald barillas in my dna
I be trappin, getting that cake, it's in my dna
Had that skeeted in the face, you caught my dna
Got a bitch in every state, it's in my dna
It's in my dna, I'm stacking paper every day
It's in my dna
Hey, hey, it's my dna,
I just pour me up ace, it's in my dna.
