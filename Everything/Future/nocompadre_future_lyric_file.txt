Me no, me no compadre

My seats on some reptile
You niggas ainâ€™t reptiles
I come with a lot of power
I come with the Aquafina
You hang on my naked married finger
I came with the chicken, I came exquisite
I wish me the check on my transportation
We came from this section 
See what I do when I came through faded
All of these niggas they gang related
Drug related got me walkin', pacin'
Peakin' out the window like a Kujo
See some real niggas gettin' dirty
Seen a pussy nigga get some recognition
20 racks inside of niggas bitches
20 bricks'll have a nigga twitchin'
They say you wanna conquer  all the mall
Diamond VBS'n, Niagara Falls
Dranks is drankin' fall asleep in the boat
Keep the stankers stankin', nigga right in my coat
Got a bracelet wrapped around my wrist
Like to see that shit light up and glisten
Want to see some fish come back a brick?
Put some bread on your head, get ya hit


Fuck around think it's a game
Fuck around, get on that drank
Fuck around with all the fuck arounds
You fuck around, get murked today
Fuck around, get work today
Fuck around with all the fuck arounds
Fuck around, you gone get paid
Fuck around, we goin' crazy



I'm not a 
We can't be reunited
Fuck it, I'm not being modest
Had a young nigga right up on the 
My jewelry hang on my wrist like I'm retarded
I came with the gang and they like  retarded
Niggas be like that bitch must been imported
Niggas shoot birds at judge in the court
Bought a chain to swang at Mardi Gras
For forty bands a nigga daddy die
Automatic, nigga air you out
I was a , never, never, more
Greedy nigga with an attitude
All the rackin' in my 
I've been known to 
All the shit gone end in casualties
I be gettin' a lot of fettuccine
I just went and bought a nigga trap
They just wanna see a nigga miserable
Put a  on 'em, leave him critical
Take the codeine and let them 
Everyday a celebration
The struggle got me dedicated
This money got me levitatin'
