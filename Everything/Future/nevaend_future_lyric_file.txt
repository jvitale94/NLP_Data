We don't wanna
We don't wanna neva end
We don't wanna
We don't wanna neva end
We don't wanna
We don't wanna neva end
We don't wanna neva


We don't wanna neva end
It's like our life has just began
You walkin' out, you comin' back again
Cause we became the best of friends
You got all the questions and I know all the answers
I took your heart, girl, holding it up for ransom
We don't wanna neva end
We don't wanna
We don't wanna neva end
We don't wanna


I could tell you was into me, from my instant chemistry
As I reflect memory, you ride or you die for me
I'll go to war over you I don't give a fuck about showing you
You know what it is, Shorty, forever my lil shawty
Long as I'm swimmin' in Benjamins, you shop with no limited
You'll see reminisce every session, know you'll come back again
I know you can't breathe without me, you gon' need the oxygen
I damn near gave you an overdose, on my own medicine
I took a sip of your tea and I ain't been right ever since
As I think to myself what it be is it heaven sent
Let's put the past behind us
And go far away where nobody can find us


We don't wanna neva end
It's like our life is just begin
You walkin' out, you comin' back again
Cause we became the best of friends
You got all the questions and I know all the answers
I took your heart, girl, holding it up for ransom
We don't wanna neva end
We don't wanna
We don't wanna neva end
We don't wanna


You could leave today, I bet you'll come back tomorrow
I could see the haters comin' from a mile up
And it's preparin' us, for what we got comin'
If they come your way, and you feel like runnin'
Run in my direction, and don't you run from me
Cause anytime we get together, we gon stunt them
And I'm applyin' major pressure, feel it in your stomach
It's lightnin', it's thunderin', it is striking got me wonderin'
Butterfly, butterfly
When you gon ever leave?
Any time you leave my side
I know you comin' back
I know you comin' back to me


We don't wanna neva end
It's like our life is just begin
You walkin' out, you comin' back again
Cause we became the best of friends
You got all the questions and I know all the answers
I took your heart, girl, holding it up for ransom
We don't wanna neva end
We don't wanna
We don't wanna neva end
We don't wanna


Is there anything you wanna know?
Is there any place you rather be?
You walk until your feet get sore
I bet you walking back
I bet you walking back to me
Actually that's a guarantee
Our friendship was guaranteed
You got my ego in another league
I ain't tryna be cocky
I got your heart in my pocket


We don't wanna neva end
It's like our life is just begin
You walkin' out, you comin' back again
Cause we became the best of friends
You got all the questions and I know all the answers
I took your heart, girl, holding it up for ransom
We don't wanna neva end
We don't wanna
We don't wanna neva end
We don't wanna
