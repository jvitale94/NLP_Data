Freak ho, Freak ho

Freak ho, freak ho
Bounce that ass make your knees touch your elbows
Freak ho, freak ho
Bounce that ass make your knees touch your elbows
Free dope, free coke, lay it down
Niggas kickin' in your front door
Free dope, free coke, lay it down
Niggas kickin' in your front door

Titanic on my wrist, bad bitch on my dick
Build a donut in the 6, I just drove by Magic City
Put the heroine in the bricks, put the heroine in the bricks
Put the heroine in the bricks, make the change, I get it
On a worldwide treasure hunt, blowin' good get it
Pretty girls reppin' pretty gangs fuckin' wit the kiddo
Type to fuck a hood nigga good then tell em get on
Went from 5 on the indo 30 rounds in the extendo
Fuck a friend tho ain't pretend tho nigga comin' through sprayin' at the window
Keep the memo, got a line I'm tryna wipe her
I ain't even got no info, the billi cold like a nigga ridin' in a limo
I been in the pussy all day, at the cribbo
I fuck a bitch she tell her friend I lost her free promo
I love a freak ho tho

Freak ho, freak ho
Bounce that ass make your knees touch your elbows
Freak ho, freak ho
Bounce that ass make your knees touch your elbows
Free dope, free coke, lay it down
Niggas kickin' in your front door
Free dope, free coke, lay it down
Niggas kickin' in your front door

Pour a lot of dirty soda in some bad bitches
Pussy rose off some coke tryn overdose
Made a ho eat a ho cuz she a broke ho
Got that check on me nigga that's a 44
My cuban links bigger than a wu tang
Lil nigga take your head off for a new chain
I send some bitch I just ain't right
I ride around town with a AR

Freak ho, freak ho
Bounce that ass make your knees touch your elbows
Freak ho, freak ho
Bounce that ass make your knees touch your elbows
Free dope, free coke, lay it down
Niggas kickin' in your front door
Free dope, free coke, lay it down
Niggas kickin' in your front door
