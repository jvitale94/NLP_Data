On the phone, cooking dope, at the same damn time
Selling white, selling mid, at the same damn time
Fucking 2 bad bitches at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
I'm on Pluto I'm on Mars at the same damn time
On the sofa, popping bottles at the same damn time

Gucci made in Italy, Bally belt I'm killing shit
The way I rock a jimmy Choo's the word got out I'm dealing it
I fuck her she a immigrant
Don't touch her she got benefits
Bussin down them benjimans
Fucking up on Louie kicks, that's the way I'm kicking it
Ferragamo cover me
Puerto Rican, Japanese, we laid up at the Double Tree
Yellow ice a bumble bee, pinky ring a quarter key
Iphone a metro, twerking off the whole thing
My ear ring a jelly bean, gangster lean and ireine
Red eyes no visine, I'm loc'd out on the bean
Horse shoes on my jeans, robbing jeans with the wings
Yellow bone on the team, trafficin that Yao Mings
Space boots with the spikes, go to AZ on a flight
Mail a hundred over night, Yeah yeah yeah yeah

I wear Gucci, I wear Bally at the same damn time
On the phone, cooking dope, at the same damn time
Selling white, selling mid, at the same damn time
Fucking 2 bad bitches at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
I'm on Pluto I'm on Mars at the same damn time
On the sofa, popping bottles at the same damn time

I'm in Fifs with the sack going crazy
Got some diamonds around my neck no flugazy
Bad bitches in the suite, trying to bathe me
Just a young hood nigga, streets raised me
Working with a unit try and stretch it to another one
Drinking on that active and it taste just like some bubble gum
Thumbing through a check, boarding on the jet
Talking on the iPhone, sipping out the Styrofoam
That dirty got my mind gone, that money got my mind blown
VVS and white stones, VVS and white stones
I'm rolling like a rolling stone
Free Bands on Al Capone
And my cash way long, (turned up)
I see a bunch of clones

I wear Gucci, I wear Bally at the same damn time
On the phone, cooking dope, at the same damn time
Selling white, selling mid, at the same damn time
Fucking 2 bad bitches at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
I'm in Pluto I'm in Mars at the same damn time
On the sofa, popping bottles at the same damn time

Give me an apartment and some water and I can swim
Got that gambino jumping out the gym
My young nigga serving jays outside crim
Jump across from me you know your chances slim
In my Aviator Gucci, like I'm driving planes
Flying cash in cash money, smell like cocaine
Doing Birdman numbers, making flips like Jackie Chan
Walk inside the jeweler drop a bail on ya rinng.
Spent so much at Louie gave me free champagne
In Bel Harbor shopping and they doing the same thang
And I keep my cup with me like a pimp
I check a Magic Don Juan, take a glimpse
Spike Lee need to get this shit on film

I wear Gucci, I wear Bally at the same damn time
On the phone, cooking dope, at the same damn time
Selling white, selling mid at the same damn time
Fucking 2 bad bitches at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
I'm on Pluto I'm on Mars at the same damn time
On the sofa, popping bottles at the same damn time.
