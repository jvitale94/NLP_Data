


Young, wild, and reckless
At least I ain't checkless
Rep the gang till I'm breathless
Rep the gang till I'm breathless
Young, fly, and reckless
Rep the gang till I'm breathless


Gotta live the wild life
Living in the wild life
Haters in ya eyesight
Let em hear them loud pipes
Let em hear them loud pipes
Let the banger go
I was in Givenchy cruising in a Humvee
Wrap your homie a mummy, I turn him into a zombie
Most these guys be fronting, there's no way I'm responding
Ben Franklin's coming, it coming in abundance
Do it how you want it, just do it ain't no fronting


Took her out for a luncheon, I put it all in her stomach
Sipping outta my cup and it's spilling all on my money
High as a fucking cannon, my flow is all they demanded
I'm back like I want revenge, she lick it up off her chin
First I had bought a Beamer then I had bought a Benz
I pray for me and my niggas cause we live a life of sin
Some'll get joined in, most of us born in
Open the door for me, I'm already going in
Pour up a 4 for me, I'm already on it
I peep the jealousy, I can see when it's coming
She knew my drive, she knew how much I want it
See how I tried to give you numerous warnin's
You wanna talk down on a nigga who born to win
Now you see that you lost out when you see what you went against
I give another chance to turn to a perfect man
I do this shit again if I can be where I'm at today






Let em hear the exhaust, show em you a boss
Peep how the Christian Louboutins look when I walk
Gotta live this high life when you in this wild life
Crush the haters with loud pipes
Crush the hater with loud ice
Gotta keep the drank cool
Bust a nigga Tadoe
Running up my pesos
Running up my cake though
14 carat gold, I'm a motherfucking ruler
Upper echelon, you my motherfucking student


Niggas I'm a don, fuck around hit the stewardess
Percocets and Zans got my head in the clouds
Gucci with the Bape, I done started a style
Full grown ape, nigga spraying the crowd
