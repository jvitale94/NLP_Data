Brought my sac in this bitch, sac in this bitch
You know we got the gas bags of the shit
Nigga if you ain’t riding up with us then you ain’t doing shit


Nigga if you ain’t riding up with us then you ain’t doing shit
I grind it up from Ducevel to 36
Feds know me, got the block hot, they watch me
Like Madlock gotta change car but call it flip flop them fake rims
They flip flop, gotta watch em boy, the block hot but but I serve em boy
Fuck niggas making no noise, them broke boys
Back in this bitch nigga straight cooling
Bands on the bitch, we could make a movie
Turn up, that’s all a young nigga know
We do this shit on the regular won’t show out for these hoes
We play smart, we grind hard, we rubber band them bands
If that the back up in the streets let my young nigga run up in them bands
Trap booming




I could of, would of, did, that’s a foreign bitch
Young nigga getting money never switch
Take a nigga hope make them bitches switch
Audemar today or the president
Presidential Rolly with a lot of diamonds
365 do a lot of grinding
Sell a lot of kush that’s that OGizzie
Drinking on that syrup gotta nigga leaning
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Whipping up that brown call it coca cola
Ball man designer in my new Givinci
Or bitch down in channel vintage
