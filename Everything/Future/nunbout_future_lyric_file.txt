He never sold them thangs
Who the hell are you (who the fuck are you)
Anybody can make it rain
Four hundred dollars on some frames (designer)

Ford Pinto laid up in Vegas

Right now I feel like racing (skirt skirt)
Put a old school Lamberts in a station
Ride presidential road
My bills are gone skating
There's ice on my wrists
I kill you long distance

They say you bought ten of them
Nobody help witness
They cash out on chickens

OK I wake up in the morning
With a bitch I don't even know
And its Sunday morning
And church i don't even go
Trap or die young jeezy and go
Time to let the people know
I can't count the time
We done hit the convenient store
Real shit I had to let that true religion and jeezy go
I've seen too many people in it
I ain't saying leave the store
I'm a leader though
Follow me on twitter hoe
Y'all talking bricks
But bitch we just got rid of four
Shit get critical
Even get a little physical
Don't care none about no bitch
Bitch I feel like mystical
Survive through the difficult
I've been with them different folks
Ain't even made it yet
What the fuck they hating on Cooley for

I don't know nunbout you
I don't know nunbout you
I don't know nunbout you
