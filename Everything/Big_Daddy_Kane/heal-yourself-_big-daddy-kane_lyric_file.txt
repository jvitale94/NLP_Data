(big daddy kane)
Mama said don't do crack and smoke you know
'cause it will make your nose grow like pinnochio
Since i was only 15 i had to listen
To what was said for my parent was a christian
I went to school and saw all my friends do it
But i said no 'cause i don't want my nose to grow
They started tripping on me, busting and flipping on me
So i had to front and say yo, true, stick it on me
I started smoking to prove i'm an adult
Now it's a habt but is it all my fault
I wished my mother would have told me the truth
'cause now i'm all based out, ma dukes

(kid capri)
Oh man i like the way that's going down
Now why won't you do is kick a little freddie foxx

(freddie foxxx)
Everybody rise as i present to a jet black crowd
What it's like to be black and proud
In a world where white is right but not tonight
This is a black man's might
I heard a sister say she don't like darker shades of black
On a man 'cause that's wack
But to my light skin sister can't you tell
You're just the surface of a dark deep well
And how can you prefer to be wit those
That sprayed you wit gun and hoses
And never put roses on the graves
Of the slaves that they treated like dirt
After all that hard work

(kid capri)
Clap your hands to the beat, c'mon, just clap your hands to the beat
Freak it now

(ll cool j)
One of the biggest lies you hear from no one else
Is when a girl tries to say she don't do it to herself
Always fantasizing but steadily denying
Last night she had to stop 'cause her baby was crying
She do it on the phone all alone wit a smile
Run the water, grab the shower cap and get buckwhyled
Soap suds on the floor, oh al b sure
Give it to me, give it to me, give me a little more
I'm fiending, creaming, screaming, dreaming (what else)
The girl's possess by the basehead demon

Chorus

(mc lyte)
In elementary, lyte had the jordache look
Like me and any other kid who cared about books
But then i got wise and i begin to listen
To the wack teachers and the wick-wack system
My mother put me in ?
Which means black school in swahili
And there is where i learned black history
And how to be the best that i can be
I went back and now the school is closed
There is nowhere for black youth to go
To be taught by brothers and sisters who knows what it means
To be a black child or a white teen
In the end the youth is being mistreated
Which means the world is being cheated

(queen latifah)
Dane was never taught her life was worth something
But when people don't try to improve it makes me want to hurt something
You want to be somebody and be a standout
But got your handout, oh you're broke, i guess it's off to your man's house
Why is sister's giving up the ball
Today it seems not to father you too hard
They call us squeezers and you prove it to the worst
You have to earn the right to say it's ladies first

(kid capri)
Oh man this is human education against lies
You better know the flavor kid

(krs-one)
Human education against lies tries
To open the eyes of humanity before it dies
Black and white ain't the real fight
That's the only thing the media hypes
The real fight are these major corporations
Holding back on real education
Before you're a color, first you're human
Teaching humanity is what we're doing

(kid capri)
And just when you thought you knew everything there was to know
You didn't know anything about this, tell 'em melodie

(ms melodie)
Daddy's home everyday since he lost his job
His new line of work is now beating up mom
Mom is scared, she doesn't know what to do
Her beautiful skin is now black and blue
She used to cry, now she's back in the pen
A human war between women and men

(kid capri)
Melodie, kid capri

(jam master jay and dmc)
Jam jay on the way, yo
Human education against lies
To all the girls and to all the guys
Get paid, get it made
Get a good grade, live to a very old age
Checking out jet, no disrespect
To each and every member of the opposite sexes
Is yes, listen to the messages and i send some
We never knew where the poison came from
Yo, we're rapping on h.e.a.l. so we thought we like to mention
Acquired immune defiency syndrome
Aids, we're here to make you get wise
Human education against lies
