Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today
For this somber occasion please join us
In the mourning of this U-47, it was a great microphone
In it's day until it met it's fate

One evening while it was in the studio
It was struck by the lyrical force of the Big Daddy Kane
So ashes to ashes and dust to dust
May this microphone rest in peace

Knock, knock, guess who? Yes, ooh
The Bigger the B, the Iggah the I
The Jigga, the G is comin' through
Yes, I'm the one with clout, they're all talkin' bout

To be frank, I have the flavor like sauerkraut
The microphone assassinator and furthermore
I murdered plenty rappers and believe that I'll murder more
So if you ask to give the Kane a go
You better treat me like drugs and Just Say No

Because I utilize my skills to brutalize
And in a battle, man, you should see what I do to guys
Whenever the mic's mine, I'll rock a hype rhyme
And come off like dirty panties at night time

'Cause any mic that I caress, I finesse
With zest and just bless, best yet to progress
King Asiatic, no other rapper stands this
You couldn't be a King if you played hockey in Los Angeles

I gets pi-daid, top gri-dade, gotta admit ey
Point blank, the kid's stri-daight
'Cause when it comes to R, A, P, P, I, N, huh
I got it locked up like a bullpen

May you rest in peace
May you rest in peace
May you rest in peace
If this meaning doesn't manifest, put it to rest

Rappers I get 'em and hit 'em
And slit 'em and split 'em and rid 'em
Acquit 'em, when I get wit' 'em
You can tell that I did 'em

I take 'em and shake 'em and bake 'em
And ache 'em and break 'em and rake 'em
You can't awake 'em from
The comatose way I make 'em

'Cause when you're messin' with me, you know what?
You can swallow a live grenade and you still won't blow up
Pickin' up the microphone you shouldn't dare
It's like bein' on a StairMaster, climbin' and goin' nowhere

You're perpetratin' like you're ready and able
But couldn't rock a show if the stage was a cradle
Your rhymes are old as an artifact
And you don't want no part of that
So don't even start it black

Anyone riffin' I show them how I'm livin'
And give them some of that treatment like my man Michael Bivins
I smack 'em up, flip 'em and then shove 'em down
Huh, oh I, ah, ah, I, ah, I, ah, I don't be fuckin' around

To rip this microphone like this today
Since 87, I came a long, long way
To headlinin', all the way from supportin'
And I know you've been watchin' me Norton

Through my whole rap career, a lot of young, huh
Rappers sat there and listened, a lot of young, huh
Rappers sat there and wishin' but
You couldn't see the Kane with x-ray vision

And just because you didn't see my crew for a few
A lot of people thought the Wolfpack was through
But if you think the Kane and Scoob and Scrap'll breakup
I tell you like Marvin Gaye, "Wake up, wake up, wake up"

Put it to rest, it's best to 'fess
Because the Kane is breakin' rappers like the IRS
And consider this microphone, the deceased
Now may it rest in peace

May you rest in peace
May you rest in peace
May you rest in peace
May you rest in peace

May you rest in peace
May you rest in peace
May you rest in peace
If this meaning doesn't manifest, put it to rest
