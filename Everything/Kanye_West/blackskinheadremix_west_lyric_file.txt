


Welcome to your life
Diamond through the light
This Miami vice
It's that life okay, okay
Dodging bullets in the air when okay, okay
There's cameras everywhere and okay, okay
You don't know how to act right
Everybody wants to rule the world


For my theme song black
My leather black jeans on black
My by any means on
Pardon, I'm getting my scream on
Enter the kingdom black
But watch who you bring home
They see a black man with a white woman skrrt
At the top floor they gone come to kill King Kong
Middle America packed in black
Came to see me in my black skin black
Number one question they're asking straight up!
Fuck every question you asking black
If I don't get ran out by Catholics black
Here come some conservative Baptists
Claiming I'm overreacting
Like them black kids in Chiraq bitch


Acting on your worst behavior
Turn your back on all your haters
Everybody wants to rule the
Everybody wants to rule the world straight up!
The world


But there's nowhere to go now
And there's no way to slow down
If I knew what I knew in the past
I would've been blacked out on your ass
Everybody
Everybody


Four in the morning, and I'm zoning
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby, we living in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it


Stop all that coon shit
Early morning cartoon shit
This is that goon shit
Fuck up your whole afternoon shit
I'm aware I'm a wolf
Soon as the moon hit
I'm aware I'm a king
Back out the tomb bitch
Black out the room, bitch
Stop all that coon shit
These niggas ain't doing shit
Them niggas ain't doing shit
Come on homie what happened
You niggas ain't breathing, you gasping
These niggas ain't ready for action, action
Ready, ready for action




So follow me up cause this shit bout to go down
I'm doing 500, I'm outta control now
But there's nowhere to go now
And there's no way to slow down
If I knew what I knew in the past
I would've been blacked out on your ass


Everybody wanna move it
Get inside it, why they do it
Everybody, ride a little bit
Everybody, body do it
Do it
Do it
