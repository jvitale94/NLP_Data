Diamonds on the Rollie, you call that Rico holmes
When I hold it up it turn the lights on
Shawty wanna fuck, lollipop homie
She can get it on butt naked with my Nikes on

No NBA tho, but I shoot to Tray tho
I pull her from the line like Andre Mayo
Keep a bad bitch from St. Louis to Valejo
Way up they don't exist (men tie Taio)


This ain't ecstasy
Yea, see I got something you gon like it
Depending on how you like it
How happy and how excited is decided by where I bite it

Ain't nothing better than me

Pull down, roll that and blow that
Come and get it girl now
And I'm a guy like Shawty know that
