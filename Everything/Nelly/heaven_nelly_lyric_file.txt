It feels like heaven


Take it to the heaven, take it to the floor
This feeling heaven-sent
Every single me and you woke
10 bottles and up, here we living up
Fly but the clouds you’ll never get stuck
And you can take your take your time, my intentions you’ll handle
So said do you see? And got me seeing stars tangled
And I’m going for the Superbowl field goal
I know you feeling it right, hot lookin tonight
It ain’t no stopping when we poppin, girlfriend go in
Yea we got high all because she touchin and rubbin
Plus above it I know you gotta be sick
But your light shine baby every time okay


It feels (it feels good)
It feels like heaven
And I don’t wanna go there girl so soon
So won’t you please come down here
It feels like heaven!


Don’t hold your breath, don’t listen
Feel like you going through hell – it’s just a visit
Feel everything you going through you’re on your own
Take a shot of the silver shot, thank God for Patrone
Thank God for the millionaires
You can separate the boys from the million now ‘cus you see your virtue
You knowin your comfort and it feels like heaven
Even though we wasn’t gonna work your body
Meet me up and down to the town
Baby I just wanna feel right here right now
One time, one choice
Baby it’s gonna fall
I hope to God never let you go
It feels like


It feels (it feels good)
It feels like heaven
And I don’t wanna go there girl so soon
So won’t you please come down here
It feels like heaven!

Sunshine every time we move
It feels like heaven!
Go angel and our love will never leave and it will live on
It feels like (go ahead still spit it so we hit it on time)
It feels like heaven
No breaking lights, baby go hard it’s fine


Never hate the ladies and make the babies
Girl you could be anything you want
And you deserve it, I know you’re worth it
Never ever let the feeling go
Never hate the ladies and make the babies
Girl you could be anything you want
Now put your hands up high, ‘cus you’re going for a ride
As the feeling of love keep your feelings inside


It feels (it feels good)
It feels like heaven
And I don’t wanna go there girl so soon
So won’t you please come down here
It feels like heaven!

It feels like
It feels… it feels like
(No breaking lights, baby go hard it’s fine)
