You better not let go (ohh!)
Cause you ain't even, you ain't even close (ohh!)
Just wait until I get you out them clothes (ohh!)
Out your clothes, yeah - I'ma show you what your body's for (ohh!)
I wanna know (uhh, uhh) don't it feel good? (HEY!)
Don't it feel good, baby don't it feel good to you? (HEY!)
Don't it feel good, baby don't it feel good?
Don't it feel good? (HEY!)
Don't it feel good, baby don't it feel good to you? (HEY!)
To you (uhh, uhh) don't it feel good?


I was ridin around in my Benz, she was posted up with her friends
I was hangin out with my partners, but I told that ass to get in
Ay girl let's go for a spin, you know a nigga got ends
She was checkin out my, checkin out my, checkin out my rims
Hey girl let's hit the hotel, make a movie more like a matinee
You know do some things you know well, thug passion baby that's Alizé (c'mon)
My car was all in yo' lane, them thoughts is all in yo' brain
My hands is all in yo' hurr, but I won't tell yo' mayne - no!




Tryin to get you up in my stable, lay you out on the table
Clear out all them dishes, let's do it like we on cable
Cut off both of them phones, girl you need to be sippin
champagne or that 'trуn, then the headboard you be grippin
My V.I.P., is the B-E-D, or the back seat of my ride
Fog up my windows so they can't see from outside
You can call me daddy, I'ma call you baby
Girl you need to get at me, who been fuckin you lately?




Yeah shorty let me see what you got
Let me see if it's wet and let me see if it's hot
Let me show you why I am and let me show you why not
Shoot 'em all night long, shawty ain't gon' stop
How 'bout I pick you up and throw you in the middle of the bed
Turn you over on your stomach, start kissin from your neck
to your back, to your thigh, to the middle of the wow
Keep goin and goin until you scream out - "Damn!"
Yeah baby girl I'm somethin like a nympho
A St. Louis, M-O with a pimp flow
So, hold on like ya limbo
and get lower, let me show ya what ya in fo'
A whole lot of bangin, man a whole lot of nights
Like a heavyweight fight with a '86 Mike
Tyson, slicin, and you're Holyfield bitin
Bitin bitin




(OHH!) Don't it feel good, baby don't it feel good to you? (OHH!)
Don't it feel good, baby don't it feel good?
Don't it feel good? (OHH!)
Don't it feel good, baby don't it feel good to you? (OHH!)
To you (uhh, uhh) don't it feel good?
(HEY! HEY! HEY!)
