Wooooooooo

Shit Lord have mercy


I never felt this way before
And she's all that I need and more
Her hips and lips belong to me
It often wakes me write out my dreams
If I knew then wat I knew now
She's still might be around because


I (I) can't go on
Oh No
I tell you what am I gonna do now (Hey)
Without her
My life just won't (it won't) be the same
I tell you what am I gonna do now (Hey)
Without
Woooooooooo

Shit Lord have mercy


I never thought that I would be
So caught up I wouldnt see
Just who would go to war for me
And take out two or three so easily
I give up everything to see if I found you (baby girl)
Cause it don't mean shit without you cause

Oh no

Without her (without)
My life just won't (it won't) be the same

That why it shocked me when she said she was leavin

Smokin one day it hit me kinda fast
That I needed to check my stash
