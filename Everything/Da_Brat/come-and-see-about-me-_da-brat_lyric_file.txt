Come And See About Me
[Da Brat]
Mystikal
What's up my nigga
It's Da Brat-tat-tat
Lettin' the whole motherfuckin' world
Know I got your back
If you don't like what my nigga Mystikal do
Come see 'bout that shit
Step to it, know what I'm sayin'
You don't like what the fuck I do, step to me
We 'gone see about your motherfuckin' ass, nigga
Huh, uh, uh

[Da Brat]
If I do somethin' you don't like
Come and see about it
You wanna box get 'cha dues somethin', or be 'bout it
And ride off into the sunset,
With the windows down, feet out it
I got a foul mouth, I blow weed out it
Seperate these thighs, get the price and eat out it
Ain't no other bitch rowdy like me
S-O, S-O, D-E-F, you C.K.
Y'all bitch ass niggas disbehave me since the first day
Worst way to kill 'em is hit the top of the charts
First week at number one, R&B be a war
Leave ya fake-ass manager home
And if you need a nigga to see about me, come along
I keep my enemies a far, don't need a friendly to me
I make at least twenty-five just to breathe on the beat
Tell me, how many niggas wanna fuck this bitch named Brat
60644 is where I'm at, come see

[Hook: Mystikal & Da Brat] 2x
You don't like!
Come and see about me
You gotta problem!
Come and see about me
You hurry up and come!
Come and see about me
What's up whodi!
Come and see about me

[Petey Pablo]
Who a that, the burnin' man, burner man
Yeah, came here to burn some ass
You don't see the burnin' man
You don't see the blazin' hands
You don't see 'em when I walk past
(All smokin' in Hell)
The So So, Da Brat brought
Petey Pab and Mystikal
Not now one of y'all
Can fuck with these bulldogs
Known for breakin' the law, just came home
Get it on 'bout this damn microphone
Who the best, who said this and who said that
Here go three of the best on this God damn track
And you can believe that
Willing to bet my drive check
If you don't rewind this back
Somethin' wrong with deck
I'ma can't forget spinnin off the wall type shit
And no it didn't, I'm talkin' 'bout y'all type shit
Greensboro to Cuira, Chapel Hill type shit
Better send them folks to check for this
Cause I'm the one that ill

Hook 2x

[Mystikal]
He's runnin' for your majesty, he's lost you with excellency
His panicked descisions definitly can't stand next to me
Dick get hard like Rob-eye, look at Hanley
You know that four can break down hits on shit, be drillin's man
We 'gone kill 'em in New Orleans, like kill 'em for jumb
As cold as the Arctic, recorded in Georgia (rouff, rouff)
None the blues don't approve, y'all niggas pink lemonade
I hit the booth, your whole crew burst the canalade
Such a bunch of fuckin' cowards
Ain't worth the dirt that come off my ass
You go down the drain when I take my shower
New Expedition via Eddie Bowers
Sometimes I gotta comb these fuckin' rappers hair, fix they collar
Wanna be like me, we can take your bitch, and smack that daughter
Be a man, and tell them bitches what you causin'
I'm a south cowboy, Howddyyyy!
Call them creepers, come and see about me

Hook 2x

[Mystikal]
I come up out the cage and, I stand ragin', keep it blazin'
Bitch I'm crazy, half man, half amazin'
Half way up the charts, and bitch I'm halfway in your ass
I'm only halfway with this rhyme, and got half y'all mad
Soon as I come in this bitch
You know I'm comin' in this bitch with somethin'
The mic parker said "that's a bad rappin' motherfucker"
I'll bust your ass up like a
Mutherfuckin' bug stuck on the windshield wiper, walkin'
Get 'cha gibber tape, for mister shit-talker
The Volgar, the champion'll knock your shows off
I'll cut 'cha like a Newport, with no gauze (oh don't)
Bitch I'm stupid like I lost a few more
Still bossin' 'em, still tossin' 'em
Still holdin' MC's hand
Takin' they ass across the street walkin'
So let me know when you ready to bust
With your head on the pavement
Bring ya ass, you don't need no fuckin' invitation
