In Luv Wit Chu
Yo, So So (wassup) So Def
Yeah, LT Hutton, uh
And it's the rat-tat-tat y'all, huh
And it's another album, huh
And it's so phat phat phat y'all

[Chorus]
Ewww, I'm in luv, I'm in luv
I'm in luv, I'm in luv wit chu
And there ain't nothin I won't do for my baby
You drives me crazy
And you make me say
Ewww, I'm in luv, I'm in luv
I'm in luv, I'm in luv wit chu
And there ain't nothin nobody can say cuz
You're the one for me baby

When I wake up in the morning (it's you)
When I can't sleep at night (it's you)
When I'm tossin 'n turnin (it's you)
When my body yearnin (it's you)

Yeah, I'm in love like Maxwell
You see me coming, but I just can't help it
My self esteem is even higher when I'm walking wit you
You give me fire and desire like Teena Marie and Rick James do
I don't care, burn up the minutes on the cell
Just turn up the music and feel that it's hard as hell
I get abusive with the flows on 'D?
When I seduce them, they just wanna hold me
Cuz I'm so smooth, and it's real not phony
With a nigga you'll never be lonely
It's beneficial, I'm hot, and since you is, let's do this
It seems I've been shot by cupid
I'm not gonna stop, think not
That's stupid cuz

[Chorus]
Ewww, I'm in luv, I'm in luv
I'm in luv, I'm in luv wit chu
And there ain't nothin I won't do for my baby
You drives me crazy
And you make me say
Ewww, I'm in luv, I'm in luv
I'm in luv, I'm in luv wit chu
And there ain't nothin nobody can say cuz
You're the one for me baby

I'm in luv wit chu more than my car, more than my house
more than the night I keep your name comin out of my mouth
I can't get you off of my mind
Finally found somebody who see's me besides what's on the outside
Fine as Roy Jones, stick 'n movin my bones
Your presence make everything else irrelevant when we close
Turn off the two way, do lay your head on my pillow
And do me baby, the rhythm gonna getcha groovin baby
And we can rock it till the broad daylight
Bodies knockin da boots, destroying property, proping me up to get through
It ain't right how you're feeling on my boo-hoo-hee-tee
It's just you and me, unexplanatory, the way that you adore me
Lord have mercy, somebody gon have to pray for me
You're worthy, my service superb, and on purpose
I swerved it all the way to your heart baby

[Chorus]
Ewww, I'm in luv, I'm in luv
I'm in luv, I'm in luv wit chu
And there ain't nothin I won't do for my baby
You drives me crazy
And you make me say
Ewww, I'm in luv, I'm in luv
I'm in luv, I'm in luv wit chu
And there ain't nothin nobody can say cuz
You're the one for me baby

When I wake up in the morning (it's you)
When I can't sleep at night (it's you)
When I'm tossin 'n turnin (it's you)
When my body yearnin (it's you)

When I wake up in the morning (it's you)
When I can't sleep at night (it's you)
When I'm tossin 'n turnin (it's you)
When my body yearnin (it's you)

[Chorus 3x]
Ewww, I'm in luv, I'm in luv
I'm in luv, I'm in luv wit chu
And there ain't nothin I won't do for my baby
You drives me crazy
And you make me say
Ewww, I'm in luv, I'm in luv
I'm in luv, I'm in luv wit chu
And there ain't nothin nobody can say cuz
You're the one for me baby

Yeah, LT Hutton, uh
And it's the rat-tat-tat y'all, huh
And it's another album, huh
And it's so phat phat phat y'all
