Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, give it to me, give it to me
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, sock it to me, sock it to me
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, give it to me, give it to me
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, sock it to me, sock it to me

You can nod your head in your jeep or your car
'Cos I'm the coldest human being that you've heard thus far
My rhymes is more hotter, I still pack a whole lotta
Nobody can't touch Shawntae, the showstopper

I do my thang with a [Incomprehensible] swang
The lyrics I bring, keeps the niggas hatin'
An' to the tick tock, ya don't stop
Would ya believe I ain't never left the scene?

I coulda stayed in your face but I waited in the wings
Patiently 'til the coast was clear
Some hoes ain't gon' have no hope this year
When I kill it, I murder it dead, sippin' on some Remi

As for my competition, find them in the hospital bed, nigga
Wishin' they ain't had no confrontation with Brat
Trippin' they whole body, mummy wrapped up in the cask
Gotta sip through a straw now an' piss in they pants, damn

Well, well, well, I'll be damned
I might as well tell you who I am
I am the capital B R A T
An' it's shockin', I'm the one you mockin', oh yes

Well, well, well, I'll be damned
I might as well tell you who I am
I am the capital B R A T
An' it's shockin', I'm the one you mockin', oh yes

JD, lemme get one of them beats please
DJ this motherfucker while I spit 16
Replay this motherfucker for the radio show
It's all about who you know an' I know everybody

You're the receiver, we dealin' for heat
Make you a believer, So So techniques
The freaks come out at night an' it's 2 in the mornin'
So what you gon' do?
I'm at the studio yawnin', JD sayin'
I can have company, so come on through

Don't you love my [Incomprehensible] 'cos it rings yo' bell
I'm more Tender than a Roni an' I'm hard as hell
If you ever wonder where I'm goin', straight up top
An' I'm the best from the West of Chi
On my block we gunnin', we runnin' shit, 'til we die, we high
I make a nigga so sick to the stomach 'cos I'm fly

Well, well, well, I'll be damned
I might as well tell you who I am
I am the capital B R A T
An' it's shockin', I'm the one you mockin', oh yes

Well, well, well, I'll be damned
I might as well tell you who I am
I am the capital B R A T
An' it's shockin', I'm the one you mockin', oh yes

Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, give it to me, give it to me
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, sock it to me, sock it to me
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, give it to me, give it to me
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, sock it to me, sock it to me

I got the strength to make it through the rainy weather an' storms
But I don't got the patience waitin' on the dough to come
I chase it until the job is done
Ain't nothin' basic about me, I'm the livest one

I'm on fire, now I see why ya bitches wanna bite me like a vampire
It's just the way that I am, really don't give a damn
From the fat on your back, it's a fact that you whack
An' you wanna be Da Brat

That'll never happen, come on, that's suicide
You might as well put your neck in a noose
Take ten Vicaden an' chase it wit gray goose
Or start your car in the garage with the door down

Sit down an' think about where the crown sittin'
It's where it supposed to be
The dome of the B to the R A T
With So So Def, new addition nigga, ABC

Well, well, well, I'll be damned
I might as well tell you who I am
I am the capital B R A T
An' it's shockin', I'm the one you mockin', oh yes

Well, well, well, I'll be damned
I might as well tell you who I am
I am the capital B R A T
An' it's shockin', I'm the one you mockin', oh yes

Well, well, well, I'll be damned
I might as well tell you who I am
I am the capital B R A T
An' it's shockin', I'm the one you mockin', oh yes

Well, well, well, I'll be damned
I might as well tell you who I am
I am the capital B R A T
An' it's shockin', I'm the one you mockin', oh yes

B R A T, yeah
