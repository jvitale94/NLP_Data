Original
And I'm young ozzy
Machine gun little tommy
Mayhem fuckin Pamela up in tha lobby
Make her shake then she bake like I'm ricky bobby
Eat the munchies then I skate like I'm playin hockey
Sex pistol everything I said vicious
I'm makin johnny cash haters eat my limp bizkits
Buy a dub then I step no skrillex
Grab the jimmy no Hendrix
Put my dick in her appendix then bust
Yeah I don’t give a fuck
I eat pussy so that means I can eat whoever I want
And these rappers smell a little fishy maybe you a lunch
Imma muthafuckin punk or you a muthafuckin punk
Tour bus full of girlfriends everybody fuck
Bamboos full of elephant trunk you call blunts
So if you with me throw them fuckin L’s up
EST or you a muthafuckin cunt bitch what
I'm hated  (bitch what, bitch what)
Muthafucka I'm hated 
Stank biotch I'm hated 
Muthafucka I'm hated 
And I don’t give a fuck bitch I'm
Big chief of chuck t’s wife beater
Still hood 4 doors no two seater
Wanita brain like a smart senior
And she pop two like she got a cold fever
Fuck bitches dudes don’t fly neither
Two liters of the brown me and tech nina
The green give me amnesia
While its kells poppin out the goddamn speaker
Not too many people keep up with the word play of my raps dog
So maybe the crititcs slow and I'm too fuckin fast dog
Theres three reason why I am better than your favorite rapper star
I can rap hard, I got better fans, and Ill beat his fuckin ass dog
Cleveland on my shoulder like a backpack
Cleveland on my shoulder look at that tat
Cleveland is the city where I'm at
Bring the cheese and turn this bitch into a muthafuckin rat trap
Fuck the course I been hated and they know that
Fuck the forest chop the trees and then we blow that
Imma taurus but I don’t bullshit
You can get the fuck out or come and get this full dick
And maybe call up a couple of fans
And then they come over because they were scared
Because they were intimidated by the noise or maybe by the Mohawk in my hair
Or maybe my boys who don't even rap
The many celebrities that it attract
Instead of adapting to ski mask
A matter of fact how bout you know what give me that
I'm hated, hated, hated, hated
Ha Lace Up bitch
Turn your face up bitch
Until then blaze up bitch
They hate us bitch
But that’s who made us bitch
That girl gon blame us bitch
And if you sleepin on the kid wake up bitch
Bitch, bitch I heard the girls like it when I say “Bitch”!
