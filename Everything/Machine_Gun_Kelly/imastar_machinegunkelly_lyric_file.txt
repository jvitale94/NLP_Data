Back from the last time
That'll be the last time that I'm saying from the last time
And I'm serious this round
I'm hold myself down and I keep it coming off like land mine
Yeah, we took the sky's like nasal's
Send me in the stars so lets hit them with a mascot
Saying that I'm speaking of tongues but I give it a fast rhyme
Never plan slowing down cause I'm living a fast life
Because Imma rip-rap star mother mother mad men
Out of the south of the bottom Mexican sand tan
And we a team so everybody throw your hands in
Who would of though Hollywood was where we land in AMEN!


Everybody know I'm that kid they wanna be me man
Gotta stay from them shades the grey
Make sure they see me man
I gotta keep on breathing man
I gotta keep succeeding man
Gotta put that city boy from Cleveland on the city map
Cause Imma star now everybody in the world wants to know my name and
Imma represent the city from which I came
So if you feel me throw your drinks in the air
We got them like (YEAH ) cause Imma star!


You can check my room MESS!
Symbolic tattoos Yes!
Number one on the ruthless, 
Live life without the move check
School days I failed test
Skinny boy check my frill chest
Even throughout my antics Kells held best Hell Yes!
I'm on my roll to prodision 
Baby you know the deal
Spill out a dragon out on the sidewalk keeping it tradition Hea 
I'm calling all the shots so they call me the animator
The youngest hustler of the year, (Yeah )


Everybody know I'm that kid they wanna be me man
Gotta stay from them shades the grey
Make sure they see me man
I gotta keep on breathing man
I gotta keep succeeding man
Gotta put that city boy from Cleveland on the city map
Cause Imma star now everybody in the world wants to know my name and
Imma represent the city from which I came
So if you feel me throw your drinks in the air
We got them like (YEAH ) cause Imma star!


We took it to the top from the bottom
I target it, I got'em
They said with my star, ya'll would tear me down like saw'em
Competition. partyed,
See ya'll in visitors parking
You paid for this event while I headline it like Marvin
Yawning, all of these rappers ain't rapping
They talking three quarters caught themselves just flapping their jaws in
Half of these rapping keeps talking about white
The slows right through my soul in
But I never through the gave all in
Hotter then the sun down in New Orleans 
I'm the big bang in the second Mileniyam
Somebody better go tell'em I'm the star
BLAHHHHH!


Everybody know I'm that kid they wanna be me man
Gotta stay from them shades the grey
Make sure they see me man
I gotta keep on breathing man
I gotta keep succeeding man
Gotta put that city boy from Cleveland on the city map
Cause Imma star now everybody in the world wants to know my name and
Imma represent the city from which I came
So if you feel me throw your drinks in the air
We got them like (YEAH ) cause Imma star!
