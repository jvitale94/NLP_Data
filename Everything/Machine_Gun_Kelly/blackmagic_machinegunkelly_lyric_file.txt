Free Boosie, wipe me down, I'm too much for these niggas 

I ain't gotta run it, but I want one
So I ain't got time for your bullshit
First thing's first, gotta get me
I need more cheese like raw heat
These hoes gon' hurt, these nigga's gon' hate
But not me, I'm a do what we do (for real)
Got Juice, got heart, got soul nigga what about you?
Early in the month
Cause The Trap Don't Close
Leotard like Snoop Dogg
We love them hoes
One thing's for certain
Two thing's for sure
One monkey can't stop my shows
These niggas can't hold me back
One lady can't slow my rush
I know why you mad
I see why you pissed
Cause you ain't got swag like this
Nah, you ain't got swag like this
Call me Tezo Tezo, a.k.a. Young Mercy Marty
Look at me I'm gorgeous, everything is flawless

Young Kellz spit that dope
Y'all rappers spit that soap
That's that fake y'all can't hang
Matter fact, take it back, grab that rope
Die Slow. I'm a bipolar, my bitch bisexual
She eat that pussy like vegetable
She just want green, cooking up edibles
Everyday I put get high on my schedule
Smoke until I cough, I love to break the law
I'm a stay in the streets
Ya'll Pigs Can Find A Trough
All I Did Was Rap
Put it on the wall
Look at all the claps
Still the Underdog, yeah!

Hop Out The Porsche Like fuck it nigga
Ride The Bench Or Score Some Buckets Nigga
Yo bitch my bitch, oh yeah, we fucking, nigga
Had her at the crib, you know she runnin nigga

Yeah, so I hopped off that Porsche like fuck it, bitch
She can ride the bench or go get buckets, bitch
You love these hoes, man, quit fronting, bitch
And if it ain't EST, it's nothin biatchhhh

Free Boosie Wipe me Down, I'm too much for these niggas
