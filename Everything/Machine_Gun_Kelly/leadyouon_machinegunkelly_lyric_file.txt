

Twice I turned my back on you
I fell flat on my face but didn't lose
Was it the blue night
Gone fragile
Was it above the man
In a wonder steady going under

Tell 'em drain the pool I'm sinkin fast
Come and save my life before It pass
Scratchin at the surface
But the bottom's where I'm at
Only place my addiction will tell me
That I'm free at last
So why the fuck you playin with my head
I said I'm done
Any and everything I had is gone
I says you won
You promised that we'd only be together for a minute
Then we finished 
But my life had passed another year
Why the fuck is you in it?
I gave up everything for you
Even my house
Now I'm beggin on a nightly basis
To sleep on the couch
My councelor said I need to find a way 
To block the pain out
I told him it was already too late
She is in my veins and he said

Tell me what lead you on 
I'd love to know

Well It's just that
When I felt her the first time, I flew
Nobody gives me the high that she do
See, we fight all the time
And she leaves bruises on my arms
But the way she makes me feel inside
That girl can do no wrong
Now all my family hates me
Since I started fuckin with her
And all my friends done left me 
Cuz they jealous that I'm with her
I tried to break it off
She gets me back with the feel
After everything she did
Why the fuck do I love that needle
Please help me

Twice I turned my back on you
I fell flat on my face but didn't lose

Look, this love's killing me
Literally
Everytime I start to pick you up
You finish me
Used to love waking up in the mornings
And feeling you
Now I'm just ashamed
And wearing long sleeves concealing you
Bitch you wasn't shit
How the fuck could you do this
Now my fucking life is ruined
Imma kill you bitch I'll do it
And so I
Tie it up
Stick that shit up in my skin
And overdose on your love 
So I can't have it again
Uh
