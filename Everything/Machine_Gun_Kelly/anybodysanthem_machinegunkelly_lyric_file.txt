who don't got inspiration to vibe to.
When you wanna dream,
got music to close your eyes to.
Let the top down,

This is my pursuit of happiness,
come and ride with me.
Its a beautiful day,
somebody feel alive with me.
Y'all wanna know what hard is,
somebody reach inside of it,
it be the ones that don't say none of that,
got the biggest size inside in them,
I was that lame kid, that sixth grade kid,
back of the class, look like a nerd,
but not the biggest brain kid.
But it was that same kid,
that made the game flip,
man of the city,
now everybody know the name kid.
Where are my sleepers at,
I mean my dreamers at,
cause I use to dream,
about this moment in my sleeping bag.
Look where I'm speaking at,
imagine eatin at Italian shops in Italy,
like where my Visa at?
Then take another seven fourty seven,
to the states the same day,
cause success is always begins 
from the place that them came, 
me I'm a city boy,
but I'm no different,
so everybody from the streets out to the country

Hold up, 
my cups is mold up, 
Ive been fightin for this change, 
my pockets are swolled up, 
even when the weathers colder, 
convertible folder, 
chilly diamond chains in my rings rose golder, 
my life 
like I'm havin a baby now, 
had to get a little chilly,
cause my tummy wasn't offically there, 
but I'm cravin now,
all that good life Kanye, 
was talkin I finally figured out,
it ain't bout my ends, 
its bout my friends family and makin out, 
and if I woulda sold my soul,
imagine what I'd be, 
so what if I ain't the most successful, 
it was ment to be, 
I learned to cope with all these emotions mentally,
express it through my music, 
my everyday is a synfony,
this is for the bird, 
this is for the block, 
this is for the nerd, 
this is for the jock,
hot shot off to the real man up, 
to the  
This your shot, 
you see the target, 
go and land on, 
this your heart, 
we are the world, 
and its your anthem

This moments classical, 
you want it magical, 
look inside of yourself, 
its autobiographical, 
its so easy to think, 
things are owed to you, 
but is those same desires, 
that grow old to you, 
just love, 
life live, 
good take advantage, 
to any opportunity, 
you should, 
and when they say you cant,
go respond and do it, 
I did the same and, 
achevied what no other rapper could, 
and it don't matter where your from, 
its where your headed to, 
if you rather than what they said before, 
its what I'm tellin you, 
half of these people, 
don't want to see you get a damn thing,
wanna pull you out the fast lane, 
and park you handicap man, 
from the streets to the crib, 
from the beach to the bridge, 
from the hood to the coldest  
don't let them hold you back, 
I spark the anthem and, 
gave you the flame burn with it, 
I'm on the top, 
you want me down, 
you better come with it
