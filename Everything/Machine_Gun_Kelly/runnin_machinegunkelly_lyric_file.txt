Cause, I'm so tired of Runnin'


I'm so tired of running, that I've worn my soles
Out, to the point that my toes is out, to the point that I can't look back and even if I did I still couldn't see where I started out, can't see home for miles, I'm
Lost like another orphan child, I'm only grinning cause I'm supposed to smile, so I do it for the ones that are down and out proud one of theirs is gonna be
A spokesman now, and I'm still running, running, but I don't know where, all I got to my name is one pair, of laced up chucks, 5 bucks, and a chip on my
Shoulder that's so big that I cannot bare, I done lost my friends, family, and home for this, and for that I have lost my mind, kept my faith, lost my direction
I'm just hoping that I haven't lost my time, Go!


I keep my head up, with my feet on the ground, From the bottom so up is the only place that I'm
Going, Ready to face all that's in front of me now, Cause, I'm so tired of Runnin' I'm walking through the fire, cause their is no way around, Moving in the same
Direction wherever the wind is blowing Ready to face what's in front of me now, Cause

I'm so tired of Runnin' Runnin I ain't running away  Cause, I'm so
Tired of Runnin'


I'm so tired of struggling, I'm so tired of hustling, I can feel my heart fill with hate, I'm so tired of loving, I was supposed
To be great, I'm so tired of ducking, Tired of coming home from my job being fired from nothing, And shit I'm tired, from the nights a motherfucker took that
Ride, to make that dream come alive, then wake up in the morning to a 9 to 5, but I gotta do it if I wanna survive, because in the city where I'm from it's
Either do or die, so choose it wise because you could lose it in the blink of an eye but even in the darkest times it's proven I


I keep my head up
With my feet on the ground, From the bottom so up is the only place that I'm going, Ready to face all that's in front of me now, Cause, I'm so tired of Runnin'
I'm walking through the fire, cause their is no way around, Moving in the same direction wherever the wind is blowing Ready to face what's in front of me

Now, Cause, I'm so tired of Runnin' Runnin' I ain't running away 
Cause, I'm so tired of Runnin'
