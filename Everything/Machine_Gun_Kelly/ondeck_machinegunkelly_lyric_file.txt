DUBO, that’s my name
But no stress, I’m on deck
The reason why she came, boy I don’t flex, I bowflex
Two girls on deck, ciroc-a-tron on deck
I blow loud, it’s so loud
I might fuck around and go death
EST my team ho, look at where we started
Let them hatin’ ass niggas know, we on deck , we brought this
Gang time, gang time, in the air like hang time
Counting bread, spending bread, I’m getting head at the same time
Cleveland is my city, Ohio my ghetto
I’mma buck up to the fullest, boy don’t make me get them medal
Shots fired, shots fired, you can fuck the ground and get wet
North-south, east-west, that Midwest is on deck

Came up from nothing
Same shit, different story
Fuck you dog, I’m hungry
I’ve got to eat and that’s mandatory
I ain’t ‘bout to just sit ‘round
Boy I’m on deck like west axe
Quick to tell the bitch get down
And she gonna fetch and you know what’s next
Run around with my crowd, we on deck, take a seat
Don’t be runnin’ your mouth, I hate hoes that talk shit
I’m on deck, on deck, fluid watch, ridiculous
19, double X, soccer team, we kickin’ it
We getting it!
That bullshit? Ready to go
Small thing to an elephant but you’d better think that I’m an animal
DUBO’s my name, 2’s up and you see me
