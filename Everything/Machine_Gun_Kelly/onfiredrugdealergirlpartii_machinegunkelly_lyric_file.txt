Tell me why that everything that's bad feels so fuckin good? Devil in a red dress, she killin' me I knew she would. So bury me one foot for every inch of heel she's wearin'. UGH, I'm in lust still I can't trust this bitch, but I keep on starin'. What? Matter of fact, fuck that no emotions let's get high as fuck. I don't need a light she fire me up, pullin' out white like a styrofoam cup, no haircut but she lines me up. What the fuck? I don't even do this shit. What would happen if my friends knew this shit? And why the hell can't I refuse this bitch? This shit is crazy.

She got her legs spread wide for the kid and she beggin' me to come and get up in it, touchin' herself, while I took off of my 11s. Gotta a girl back home, and she callin' every minute. So I pick up like, "Bitch! Mind your motha fuckin business! " I'm serious. I'm trippin'. No, literally I'm trippin' out of all those drinks anything could've slipped in. Not to mention what she had me sniffin'. But she grabbed my dick, told me to forget about it and bit my lip. I told her, "Turn around while I turn the music loud. Whenever the bass hits then you strip." And then she did, but she pulled a little baggie out of her panties and put a pill on her breast. My mind said no, my dick said yes. I'm willin' to do whatever to feel her sex. This shit is crazy.

And she told me, "Speed it up, fuck me good, beat this pussy up like you should. Lay back down, keep it up, lemme show you how a real bitch do." All she wanna do is get dick and run. All I wanna do with this chick is cum. I've been in the pussy for about 2 hours, but I can't feel my shit, I'm numb. Her legs shakin' and my legs do the same, but it moves to my chest, to my brain, to the nerves in my face, so I can't feel that motha fucka. This ain't novocaine, bitch quit playin'. I don't even know your name. What the fuck you do to me? She said, "I'm the same one sellin' Oz. to Mike P and the one that made you OD." You stupid bitch...
