And provide the best scene for the fights?
You know the words, action!
Mine's gold-plated, all animated
Never outdated
Cardio-pass inspection
Feel the heat and the breeze
Inferno without the disco
So we never  to your needs
(It's physical) Best believe
(It's actual) -ly part of the plan
 the art of a man it's a beat
Known to keep a  still in the fee
Our action's not act
We're bound to make you (move) in fact
Just (move) get up (time to go)
We'll be right there without a care like

(Ooh this thing is physical, ooh this thing is virtual)
(Move, get up, time to go, move, get up, time to roll)
(Ooh this thing is magical, ooh this thing is actual)
(Move, get up, time to go, move, get up time to roll
A-C- (action) -T-I- (action) -O-N- (action), let it all begin
A-C- (action) -T-I- (action) -O-N- (action), let it all begin, aight

With energy and motions, while y'all emotional
Pros and partays but not promotional
 be free, dangerously and apoctic
And there's no way for you to stop it
Cause we never stand still and y'all just anvils
Geographically rooted in landfill
Meaning y'all are trash, that's it
And I gotta move the dance like that's the fit
And the formula I admit for the tape
Hands reaching for pieces to break
It feels so good that for Goodness sake you just (move)
Get up, no need to let up (move)
We got the action to make you (move)
We own the action to make you (move)
We are the action to make you (move)
Get up, time to go

Ooh this thing is physical, ooh this thing is virtual
Move, get up, time to go, move, get up, time to roll
Ooh this thing is magical, ooh this thing is actual
Move, get up, time to go, move, get up time to roll
A-C- (action) -T-I- (action) -O-N- (action), let it all begin
A-C- (action) -T-I- (action) -O-N- (action)
A-C- (action) -T-I- (action) -O-N- (action), let it all begin
A-C- (action) -T-I- (action) -O-N- (action)
