And All I Ever Wanted Was Love
I Used To Love Without Fear A Long Time Ago
And All I Ever Wanted Was Love
Then Somebody Came Around And Tried To Hurt Me
Tried To Make Me Feel Like I Was Unworthy
Took Pure Love And Tried To Make You Dirty
Truth Was, That He Never Did Deserve Me No
I Had To Lose Myself
So I Can Love You Better
I Had To Lose Myself
I Had To Lose Myself
So I Can Love You Better
I Had To Lose Myself
I Had To Lose Myself
So I Can Love You Better
Lose Myself In Love
And That's Just The Way It Is

You Couldn't Tell Me I Was Love When I Needed It
When All I Ever Wanted Was Love
Should've Told Me Just Because You Were The Receiving End
But All I Ever Wanted Was Love
There's Something … About The … It Takes To
Give Love And The Good That It Makes You
True Love Can Never Really Forsake You
But It Took A Little While Just For Me To See
I Had To Lose Myself
So I Can Love You Better
I Had To Lose Myself
I Had To Lose Myself
So I Can Love You Better
Lose Myself In Love
And That's Just The Way It Is

I Had A Paralogic Fear Of Facing Failure
And I Couldn't Love You Perfectly With Fear In My Head
So I Perilously Had To Face The Danger
So I Could Come Back And Love You Whole Instead
I Love You …
So I Can Love You Better
I Had To Lose Myself
I Had To Lose Myself
So I Can Love You Better
I Had To Lose Myself
I Had To Lose Myself
So I Can Make It Better
Lose Myself In Love
And That's Just The Way It Is

And So It Goes That I Never Meant To Hurt You
Couldn't Stay But I Never Meant To Desert You
Whole Lot Of Things That I Just Had To Work Through
Time To Heal And Restore Myself …
Confrontation Of My Fears And Anxiety
Cried A Whole Lot Of Years I Suffered Quietly
I Know It May Have Taken Years, I Can Finally
Tell You That You Were Always On My Mind
I Had To Lose Myself
So I Can Make It Better
I Had To Lose Myself
I Had To Lose Myself
So I Can Make It Better
I Had To Lose Myself
I Had To Lose Myself
So I Can Make It Better
Lose Myself In Love
And That Was Just The Way It Is

It Takes Strength To Absorb All The Abuse I Did
Greater Love To Absorb All Of The Abuse I Did
Hey Baby Its Not An Excuse I Did
And I'd Do It All Again Because For You I Live

It Takes Strength To Absorb All The Abuse I Did
Greater Love To Absorb All Of The Abuse I Did
Hey Baby Its Not An Excuse I Did
And I'd Do It All Again Because For You I Live

I Had To Lose Myself
So I Can Make It Better
I Had To Lose Myself
I Had To Lose Myself
So I Can Make It Better
I Had To Lose Myself
I Had To Lose Myself
So I Can Make It Better
I Had To Lose Myself
I Had To Lose Myself
So I Can Make It Better
Lose Myself In Love
And That Was Just The Way
And That Was Just The Way It Is
