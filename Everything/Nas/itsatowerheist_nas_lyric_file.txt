Christian pendants, Islamic thoughts, criminal courts
Father forgive, I wanna die like Godfather did
Standing in lineups and paying lawyers, aint tryna bid
Alliances, surveillance watching ‘em, careful when plotting
My boys were captured on video, farewell to my partners
Ski mask and fake tags, in case the car was spotted
Lavish hotels, central park west, fly apartments
Lets rob it, forensics get a sentence so be the smartest
It’s live, it’s a Saturday night as I load up a cartridge
Let off the fully, got alliby’s, no need to worry
Done right, we don’t see the prosecutors or grand jury
Reputed Mobster style, take the money and run
Count it in warehouse’s, leave town and live a hundred years like crocodile
Straight up NYC, like a Mets fitted
This a tower heist, even Donald Trump could get it


You want respect money and Power right
Well lets ride tonight, it’s a tower heist
You want respect money and Power right
Well lets ride tonight, it’s a tower heist
Tower heist, even Donald Trump could get it!


I got my shades on, got my money in my pocket, got my J’s on
Spent a hundred for my watch, I feel amaze-on
It’s a jungle in these streets
Choppers be going bang, ya’ll people need me decreased
Everyday is war, living legends you must applause
So light my cigar, for the foreigners living large
Dealing straight raw, the Mercedes in my garage
Your girl on my dick, and I may just feel like menage
I came for the cash, me and Nas behind the mask
Cause bitch, its a heist, give me or lose your life
I profit so nice, me and dog gon’ count it twice
It’s poppin’ tonight, roll a weed, give me a light


You want respect money and Power right
Well lets ride tonight, It’s a tower heist
You want respect money and Power right
Well lets ride tonight, it’s a tower heist

Straight up tower heist, even Donald Trump could get it!

You want respect money and Power right
You want respect money and Power right
It’s a tower heist
