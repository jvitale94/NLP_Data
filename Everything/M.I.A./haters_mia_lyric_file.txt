Yeah I could show you things that could make you sick
There's a satellite above me that's taking pics
And the army from the west have started sending mix
And I'm sat in America doing tricks
So the army's looking at me like I'm a bitch
And I'm thinking bout the babies lying in the ditch
Thinking if they had a kite phone you’ll see this shit!
And what you see on MySpace just a little bit...
And the story’s always fucked by the time it hits
Why the hell would journalists be thick as shit?
Cuz lies = Power = Politics

I'm a sinner, never said anything else
I didn't lie to you, thinking of somebody else

You live in the mansions, stealing from the sick
Did my tsunami money go to your chicks?
For her Bentley, is she riding your dirty dick?
Your son can go to Harvard to learn the tricks
Like economics eats the poor like a Twix
In the third world sticks would sniff you out like dicks
You write your own reviews to get away with it
You can talk shit to me, I'm used to it!
You make me hard with the wounds that I had to lick
You can pick on me and I can see it at a click!
You're a racist, I wouldn't trust you one bit!

I'm a sinner (by theirself, by theirself, I live valorous)
Never said anything else (make and take and you take a chance and you know that I'm a winner!)
I didn't lie to you (by theirself, by theirself, I live valorous)                                                                           Thinking of somebody else (make and take and you take a chance and you know that I'm a winner!)
