It starts when you ready
It starts when you ready

It starts when I'm heading over
Getting blessings in the shower
Looking in the mirror (mood emoji fire)
Trying not to remember
My time in the fire
Cause ain't gonna tell ya
This war is never over
I ride through the sea like a pirate
Just to float in the water
Can't carry feelings
Like basket can't carry water
Ain't gonna tell ya
That I live strictly for the paper
Men are good, men are bad
And the war is never over

Survivor, survivor
Who said it was easy?
Survivor, survivor
They can never stop we

G.O.D
Gold and oil and dollars
Stars come and go
Just like every empire
I stay fly focus
I'm staying higher
Now power up your lighter
For you know you are a survivor

Survivor, survivor
Who said it was easy?
They can never stop we
Survivor, survivor
Who said it was easy?

Watch yourself heading over
Heading over
Watch yourself heading over

It starts when you ready
It starts when you ready

Survivor, survivor
Who said it was easy?
They can never stop we
Survivor, survivor...
