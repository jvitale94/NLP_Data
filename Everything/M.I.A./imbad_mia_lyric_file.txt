I am so bad, they call me the terrorist, 
there's many haters that are calling never wrist
You wanna take a risk, find me and Ill tie your wist
you wanna get me pissed you will end up on my wishlist

I try, I try, I try to be good yeah I try 
I try, I try, I try to be good yeah I try

I'm ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba I'm bad 

Shi-bi-dibi-dii di-bi-di-bi-dii-dii, who is in the tree? He trying to shoot me
Shi-bi-dibi-dii di-bi-di-bi-dii-dii, who is in the sea? He trying to shoot me

Like somalian yeah I’m in the sea
I get all of your guns before you get me
Go to the army trying to find me
but that ain’t going to happen cause you can’t track me.
I’m bad, I’m better, I’m even more fed up
not afraid to lose in my bootleg sweater
You can call the government and call me a terror 
but I say your trick is to get more cheddar

I’m ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba I am bad 

I try, I try, I try to be good yeah I try 

You're fucked and corrupt and you know I'm just bad
You say give peace a chance, I say piece a C4 chance
You punks play pranks cause your campaign works on grants
Thats why I make them bounce and hide out in the south of France

I’m ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba I'm bad
