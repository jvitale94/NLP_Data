Nine months, got a baby carriage
One year, your stuff's in the storage
My love is just your...

Water under the bridge
Water under the bridge, what!
Water under the bridge
Water under the bridge, what!

Every day I love you less and less
It's clear to see that you're obsessed
I've got to get it to the press
That every day I love you less and less

Every day I love you less and less
I've got to get it off my chest
The doctor says I need the rest
Since every day I love you less and less

Ho-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I wanna let you know my mates love me
Ho-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I wanna let you know my folks love me
Ho-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm gonna let you know my girls love me
Ho-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm gonna let you know your mates love me

Cocoa butter made by Palmer's
Used to love me in my pajamas
We used to share our lamb shoulders
When it rains, it pours like...

Water under the bridge
Water under the bridge, boy!
Water under the bridge
Water under the bridge, what!

Ho-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Iâ€™m gonna let you know my mates love me
Ho-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm gonna let you know my folks love me
Ho-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I wanna let you know my girls love me
Ho-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I wanna let you know your boys love me

What?
Pow, pow, pow, pow!
What?

Every day I love you less and less
It's clear to see that you're obsessed
I've got to get it to the press
That every day I love you less and less

Every day I love you less and less
I've got to get it off my chest
The doctor says I need the rest
Since every day I love you less and less

Every day I love you less and less
It's clear to see that you're obsessed
I've got to get it off my chest
Every day I love you less and less

Every day I love you less and less
I've got to get it off my chest
Every day I love you less and less
Every day I love you less and less

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm gonna let you know my folks love me
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I wanna let you know my mates love me
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm gonna let you know your friends love me
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm gonna let you know my mates love me

Boy
Pow, pow, pow, p-pow!
