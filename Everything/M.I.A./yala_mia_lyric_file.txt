Y.A.L.A


Go low, go slow
Run like a polo
Up and down that pole
Like you're goin up a yo-yo


Yea, yea, Y.O.L.O
Yea, yea, Y.O.L.O
Dance go off when I enter the building


Y.A.L.A


I drink some cointreau
Keep it in my poncho
Light up like Castro
Blow up and get go
Pro when I set, go
Grow like an afro
Play like Ronaldo
Hard like I'm Death Row
Weight in kilo
Light as a pillow
Don't tie my tip-toe
Like I tae-box though


Come come come
When we come with some some
Yeah a glass of rum
Yea I got me some pom pom
For fun fun fun
Let's get 'em undone
With a hit on the bong
It's been so long since we hung






Yeah!
Empty wowo
And I am understood
I get the lo-lo
Searching for me unfold
Bankin' offshore
Take a trip to Singapore
I need to earn like
I'm Julianne Moore
For the oracle
Don't wanna igno
That's why I say shit
So they can explore
My baby, I am more
My mommy I adore
I tried to stay poor
Can't take it anymore










Y.A.L.A. Y.A.L.A
I'm flying solo (Y.A.L.A.)
You can take a photo
I'm a keep it wowo (Y.A.L.A.)






Y.O.L.O.?
I don't even know anymore
What that even mean though
If you only live once why we keep doing the same shit?
Back home where I come from we keep being born again and again and then again and again
That's why they invented Karma
