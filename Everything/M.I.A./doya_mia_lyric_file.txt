Yeah, I'mma fuck that
Yeah, I'mma feel that

Just do ya, do ya, do ya

Yeah, how you ride that?
Yeah, how you be that?
Yeah, how you do that?

Just do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya

Let me hear ya try and mack
Let me touch ya front and back
Let me grab ya like a gat

Just do ya, do ya, do ya

Let me break you at the sack
Take your tic to my tac
Do my dance on ya lap

Do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya

Get me books to read me
Get me films to show me
Get me food to feed me

When I do ya, do ya, do ya

Make me scream so freaky
Make me dream so freaky
Make me freaky-deaky

When i do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya

Let me sway like gypsy
Let me sip 'lot a whiskey
Let me talk that Hindi

As I do ya, do ya, do ya

Sexy roxy-roxy
I get juicy-juicy
Can you film me, film me

As I do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya?
