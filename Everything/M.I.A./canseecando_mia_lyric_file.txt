Staying up together till dawn
Does it make a difference
If we all become the same pawn?

Looking back at history
Yeah, all the things that it's shown
Some things are just do
And some things are just don't


Can see, can do
Can see can do, can you?
Can we get past history?
Wanna make a future with you

There's only a few things that I really really get
Yeah, you know, I'm sure about that
There's only a few things that can knock me off my track
Yeah, cause I'm sure about that
There's only a few things that I really, really get
Yeah, you know, I'm sure about that
There's only a few things that can knock me off my track
Yeah, cause I'm sure about that

I keep it going like it's never enough
Chasing the masses and the things above
Some people see planes, some people see drones
Some people see a doom, some people see domes



I keep my shoulders up, my head all wrapped up
Circumstances, it makes my mind fucked up
I keep it cool when things are hot, act up
I stay on it, on point, they can't catch up




(Na-na-na-nana-nanana)
(Na-na-na-nana-nanana)
(Na-na-na-nana-nanana)
(Na-na-na-nana-nanana)

Bring loads, I got two roads
One: privacy, two: piracy
Stay on the DL, don't wanna get caught
In 'n' out at the VS
P.S., do you wanna drink beers?
Heineken Black, Sonnen, that's what we do, yes
Brought what? Side to side, but nothing spill
Just a bit on my shoelace
