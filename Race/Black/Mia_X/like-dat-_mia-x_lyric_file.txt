Somebody better tell these dumb hoes somethin
Cuz when i roll thorugh i ain't gone say nothin
Ain't shit to talk about
Cuz i can do without the souljah hatin
Them hoes is jealous of my fame and the money that i'm making
Got they heads aching
So they acting like they got beef
Knowin damn well if htey see me they gone speak
I'm mama i'm respected y'all know this
But shits gone really get hectic
If y'all don't stop slow this??? down now
The issue ain't who i'm loving or fucking
The big issue's billboard cuz i'm on top of it
The issue is i got my kids up out the projects
And bought my moms a new house
Before my second album came out
Respect my mind
I took my grandparents out the hood
I'm seein to it that their golden years be all good
So bestill the fact that i ain't selfish or greedy
Ask my people am i there when they need me
Like dat

I'ma leave you hoes in the same place
No progess
Talkin bullshit while i elevate
And i'ma keep looking out for the real
But i don't give a fuck how the rest of y'all feel
And i'ma keep on learning the game
And i encourage all the my souljahz to do the same
I come in peace and i try to pack fair
But if you want to i will take you there
Like dat

Now i don't owe a motherfucker a god damn thing
And i earned the right to be the biggest mama on the tank
I sacrified beaucoup
Put in so much work
Kept it tru cuz i'm tru
And represented my turf
Downtown seven ward hard head
Ya heard
Around a gang of uptown niggaz
Straight screamin the third
Been bout it
Been rowdy
Been throwin for mines
It was just me and jill on the scandalous rides
No hip hop lines to make me sound hard
It ain't no act
It's a fact
When it's on i go off
But as god as my witness
I love being nice
Until this playa setting in my household was right
I like to just be me
While you be with your knot
I'm trying to stay on top with tru niggaz fo sho
And we extend our hands to pull up more
Like dat

repeat 2x
