I'm tired of trying to try not to cry and,
I say soda, soda!
Tye Dye O'er
I roll the dye,
I coast, I dose I...

A smile a guise,
I'm trying to hide behind tired eyes, I sigh.
I might survive the nighttime, I might die
I say soda soda, I'm high roller,
Yo sir, I pose for the poster, yep!

Icy cola cola, sprite I love the mosta!
I ride rollercoasters! I try all the cultures!
A smile, a guise,
Nighttime, is mine to lie eyes a wide and I...
I'm tired of trying to try not to cry and...

I say soda!
I'm Iota, yo sir,
I ride roller-
I try all the cultures!
Light my swollen smoker,
I might comatosa,
I once used to be your girl.

I used to be your girl...

Been too busy, but I don't wanna deal with you
Been thinking bout the way you treat me right, yeah...
It's you and me, but I don't wanna deal with you,
Been thinking 'bout, the way you'll leave me right, here...
