Whistle out, I'm gonna switch you, lift you, get when I hit you
With this smile, I'll make you, make you wow now, when I'm with you
With you now I can't forget you, get you now


Hey, hi, hello, yo, what's up my oh me oh boy
What's word could I call ya?
Up late, I'm the one, I'm from New York
My oh mi amor, who told you could, look so good
Who says that you lay next to me?
Why can't we catch up before your way, your way
Ooh my love, my luxury's waiting
If you want, you want to stay
Let me in your world
You know what I spy?
Spy you looking lonely, you know boy that's why
I wanna be your lady, Your l-l-l-love, my l-u-x-u-r-, aye ya know what I would
If I could, if I could, if I could

Whistle out, I'm gonna switch you, lift you, get when I hit you
With this smile, I'll make you, make you wow now, when I'm with you

Oh, took a trip, took a boat, took three friends
This bitch said it's open season
This Miss been alone and she been
Looking for some gentlemen and
I'm hoping he been
Feeling what I'm feeling and I hope that he can
Chill up in the Villa for the whole damn weekend
Just coast with her, put your hands on the figure,
Now you're groping her, groping her


Listen now, I hip you, hip you now when I whistle
Whistle out, I'm gonna switch you, lift you, get when I hit you
With this smile, I'll make you, make you wow now, when I'm with you
With you now I can't forget you, get you now

Spy you looking lonely, you know boy that's why
I wanna be your lady, Your l-l-l-love, my l-u-x-u-r-, aye ya know what I would
If I could, if I could, if I could

Whistle out, I'm gonna switch you, lift you, get when I hit you
With this smile, I'll make you, make you wow now, when I'm with you
