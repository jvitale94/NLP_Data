Two days later the fuckin advance
Shootin dice, Gettin right, Holdin hands
Jumped off the plane, You my only flame word to my mans
I've been loyal you can have anything I grant you
From kicks all the way to trips to Japan
When we land I'ma blaze it in a van
Hope to get caught, Just make this short
Just get yours and dance on it, Talk to me


Spent my lifetime trying to find you
Got used to being misused and
Had my heart broken so many times
I got the scars to prove it
Baby please won't you be patient
I know I'm hard to deal with
Something I said I'd never do
But I'm letting down my guard for you
Ohh, So many lies and deception
I've dealt with so much rejection
I took a look at my reflection
And said I'll never love again
But I count you as a blessing
Cause you were sent from Heaven
Baby you changed my mind
What we got is so hard to find


Ohh, Love like this
Don't come, Round but once
Once in a lifetime, (Once in a lifetime)
And it's the right time, (And it's the right time)
For us, Ain't no kiss
Ever, Felt like this
But once in a lifetime, (Once in a lifetime)
And it's the right time, (And it's the right time)
For us


Pay attention to the details
When I talk you listen
You make me wanna try harder
To be a better women
I think I'm fallin baby catch me
I see the happy ending
I didn't think that dreams came true
But your love is proof
Ohh, So many lies and deception
I've dealt with so much rejection
I took a look at my reflection
And said I'll never love again
But I count you as a blessing
Cause you were sent from Heaven
Baby you changed my mind
What we got is so hard to find




Ohh-oh-oh, Can't nobody make me feel like you do
(You know I got you baby) Ohh-oh, (Come on man)
(You know how I rock man)
Everybody wants to feel like we do
(Let me take you to Louie Star real quick man after that man)
Ohh-oh-oh, (Lets go hit the museum or somethin man)
After all the things that I have been through
(Word up ma) Your love is healin me
(You know I'm reppin you man) It's change'n me, I feel brand new.


We like fifth grade lovers when we first linked up
You had a mink on, A baby joint, Your rings was tucked
I'm blacked down in the back of the town, Crime'n
Doin white collar shit, But then you came and blocked my design
I looked at you with a sinister grin, You looked back
That was a win, I shot my biggest gift, This is a ten
Months passed like blunts get passed
You riffin just when I was different
You decided to flip, Get prolific
Threw my shit out, I let that ride, Kicked the kid out
I slid out, I fell back, My women ain't live
I thought love and trust would hold our hands
Straight disaster happened, I lost the only thing, Just don't even answer
When I came through crowned you as my Queen you was thankful
I sat proud royalty style, Go hit the bank Boo
A few weeks later we back but with the same drama again
I love you Boo, God is within, Give us love
