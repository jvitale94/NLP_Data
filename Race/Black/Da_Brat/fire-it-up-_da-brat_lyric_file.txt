My day starts out light but it is very heavy as the night approach
When I take flow from all dat smoke dat I smoke, no joke
As I commence to take flight it's gotta be first class
'Cuz this ass could give a fuck about coach, bitch

(How high do you fly when you fly back?)
From da bottom to top, top to bottom and back

Now as I lay me in da cup gettin' fucked up
Puffin' on blunts and comin' up with some mo of dat funky stuff
Rough and tough is not enough to keep my focus
No it's dat hocus pocus abracadabra smokeyas

Fills up da room as I breathe again
One smoke from da ghetto, it's dem braids and
When flossing in my Benz, with my friends it begins
Smell the aroma puttin' you in a coma

It's dat super sanky dank that'll make ya faint go blank
Hey, when I hits da door all my niggas say

(It's probably all dat chronic that I smoke)
Oh, how we love it when ya fire it up
Layin' in da cut, gettin' real fucked up
(It's probably all dat chronic that I smoke)
Oh, how we love it when ya fire it up
Layin' in da cut, gettin' real fucked up

It's a new day, new day truly ain't nothin' changed
Fall up out my bed to the same ol' thangs
Your averaged, everyday black surrounded, bar-b-que, a little weed
It's some niggas with some bass pounding

One o'clock is da time to raise
Take a shower, brush my teeth and correct my braids
Now listen up to what I say
Because this typa shit, it happens everyday and

(I gotta place where I soak some so)
In da summer it's a coolin', in da winter it's a smoke ho
Twenty feet away from da house in da back
Surrounded by a gate, draked in all black

(It's where me and my homies go
(Smokin' on that thang till it ain't no mo)
How we smoke?
(We smoke till I blast some mo)
Doin' my thang, kickin' back relax and then

(It's probably all dat chronic that I smoke)
Oh, how we love it when ya fire it up
Layin' in da cut, gettin' real fucked up
(It's probably all dat chronic that I smoke)
Oh, how we love it when ya fire it up
Layin' in da cut, gettin' real fucked up

We like to smoke, we like to smoke
We like to smoke, baby
We like to smoke, we like to smoke
We like to smoke, yeah

We like to smoke, we like to smoke
We like to smoke, baby
We like to smoke, we like to smoke
We like to smoke, yeah
