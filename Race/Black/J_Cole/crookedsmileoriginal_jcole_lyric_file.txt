I ain't gon' sit around and front like I ain't thought about it
A perfect smile is more appealing but it's funny how
My shit is crooked look at how far I done got without it
I keep my twisted grill, just to show the kids it's real
We ain't picture perfect but we worth the picture still
I got smart, I got rich, and I got bitches still
And they all look like my eyebrows: thick as hell
Love yourself, girl, or nobody will
Oh, you a woman? I don't know how you deal
With all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels
I feel for you
Killing yourself to find a man that'll kill for you
You wake up, put makeup on
Stare in the mirror but its clear that you can’t face what’s wrong
No need to fix what God already put his paint brush on
Your roommate yelling, "Why you gotta take so long?"
What it's like to have a crooked smile


A crooked smile
A crooked smile
This crooked smile

Listen
I got a story for ya. When I was 17
I had a name that was far from lame and that meant everything
I hit the club with my nigga Ced. ain't nothing new
But on this particular night that we was coming through
Niggas was on the stage, battlin' babblin', going no where
I figured "Fuck it. It's a couple hoes here."
I might as well sign up
And climbed up the stage
I went first, I kicked my verse
Spit like a lion out the cage
The crowd feeling my rage
I aired the nigga
Tossed the mic right to 'em like i dared the nigga
Thought I scared the nigga
DJ started the beat
His heart started to beat
Fast. the part of defeat
The nigga verse was weak
That is until he said this
"You ain't So So Def, your teeth just got Jagged Edges"
Damn, that was the dagger
That killed my swagger
I never hit that stage again I beg my mom for braces
Then I had a crooked



Growing up just a young knuckle head running wild
Momma youngest everybody knew I was the problem child
Front teeth missing in my smile
Snagga tooth nigga for a while
Liftin up my pillow tooth fairy never came around damn
We was po, but I ain't know
Mouth open at the mirror daily
Lookin', wondering how my teeth would grow
They came slow and out of line
I couldn't comprehend the significance at the time
This crooked smile was just another sign
Saying life ain't fair
Some niggas had the perfect smile with the nice wave hair
Oh yeah remember Brandy Loved her like candy
She went with my nigga sosa
I was scared to approach her
That nigga had the fresh new gear
J's drop. he got a fresh new pair
And there I was with hand me downs
Turned into the class clown, teachers couldn't stand me now
Defense mechanism, lookin' for attention with this crooked smile
