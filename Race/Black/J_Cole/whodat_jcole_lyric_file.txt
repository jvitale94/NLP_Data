I mean the shit was all bad just a week ago.
Rappers is bull shittin. Fuck it,

And did I fail to mention?
Your bitch is tired of missionary,
boy you failed the mission.
Speakin of positions? Just witness
how I elevated. Real niggas celebrate it, finger-fuck
whoever hate it. My life accelerated,
but had to wait my turn. But then I redecorated,
that means my tables turn. Live life, might as well,
only way to learn. Is try and fail clientele
the only way to earn. So if you're sellin crack..
or if you're sellin rap. Make sure it's mean
so them fiends keep on trailin back.
