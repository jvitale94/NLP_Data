A quarter milli and a Buick, Nigga guess who?
It came to me like the dream that I once had
Them niggas said I couldn't do it, then I busted through
And now I'm flying worldwide, singing rap songs
Fucking all the bad hoes that I once knew
And busted nuts for all the times I was shitted on
See it was once fuck me, now it's fuck you
Clearly, now hear me
Back with a vengeance, hope you niggas feel me
You cut me deep and know it hurts severely
I'm a forgiver, I still love you dearly, sincerely
It's Truly Yours, bout to stack another quarter milli
Nigga got a quarter milli, don't be silly
