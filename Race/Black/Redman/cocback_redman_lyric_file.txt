Hey Yo baby I'm back like Carter
The Don Dada
Stuff sour diesel in the God Father
Go hard or go home
Streets on the phone like red
Takin it to the max like top shotta.
Proper how da man keep a plan how to pop up
That's why I spit like a Louisiana
Chopper. Mr. chief rocker do it all I done it
Any mc around ain't clear... I run it
Yeah I got my chest out blunts got my mind right
16 bars about the size of a
Klondike. Mr show stopper
When I am done a bar fight
Now I get treated like
Kids around mike
Get it rock the NY fitted New Jersey
Do it quick as a NY minute
Got the smith like emit.
I run it back skip town
Hot 16's is the only way I'm
Doing a sentence.
Sky's the limit think I'm bigger than wall st
Chris Wallace said
It my pen got it's heart beat.
What up to Marcy
Brooklyn I'm sorry I ain't kicked it
So I signed up for Karate.
Hip hop monopoly pass go 3 times
Ordered TiVo for
Assholes to rewind
(Gilla House we grind)
Aye boy get em off us never sleep no
Caffeine to make a star – buck


Coc bak – spit it out coc bak – spit it out

Lyrical bang bang on the track man down
Coc bak – spit it out coc bak – spit it out

Lyrical bang bang on the track man down


Inhale – exhale I'm proof that sex sells
Now watch my bank account boost like a Nextel
From Marseille Paris to Cali
You can find me where ever the Bally
Probably with Halle bury the Audi
Interior whiter than Bill O'Riley
I'm Akbar Preme mixed with Muhammad Ali
Plus I got Big L spirit inside me
Your money like Bob Green my money like Yao Ming
Everybody gets scrilla on my
My team we shine like high beams
The dream like Akeem that's why I'm the prince
Like Naseem nah mean.
Ready da man aak
It's big Willie stay fly like Hancock
Catch
Me in Jam Rock with niggas with dread locks
That never waste bullets all they do is
Take head shots shots shots.
Fire shots man down these damn clowns shoulda knew
Ready was the man now.
I hooked up with Gilla &amp; figured the plan
How to be #1 in
Hip hop hands down plan down.
Clamp down like pliers this man on fire soughta
Like Denzel or Marlo from the wire
The rap rowdy piper Makhi Phifer the D.Csniper.
I'm gonna need me a diaper up in my new Viper.
