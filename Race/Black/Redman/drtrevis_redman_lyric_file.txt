OK Redman, on the count of three I want you to
completely forget how you did the first album
Erase data number four exhibit C-Y protanium
Now... what I want you to do is concentrate
Concentrate on how you will do the second album
No funk element too nucleus to the ninth power
Exhibit four-L-W
Now... when I count to three
I want you to fall into a deep mind of emotion
But before you do Redman, I want you to
Light this shit up high!



Tired of burning, ahhhh!
 Kill that motherfucker
Yeah, help me get out of here
 Die nigga die!
I don't wanna die
 Die!  Hehehehehe


I want you to concentrate very hard on how you will do the second album
I want you to take the funk where it has never gone
I want you to take this LP to where no other LP has risen
You son of a bitch!!
Dr. Trevis signing off

 
Ahhhhhh...
You are now about to enter the psychotic mind of Redman
Let's take a journey on a funk cosmic adventure
to where no other nigga or bitch has ever entered
Let me lick your funky emotions with my cosmic lyrics
From a place we call hell, and beyond...
