Women gather 'round like "Oh my God, he's in my iPod"
Peace to the god, sayonara bitches
There's no second time around like Shalamar
Hit the New York bar, high on the broccoli
Then hit Queens for a queen like King Jaffe
Sixteens I go off like Biz Markie
Sixteen rounds, I buck like Milwaukee
Come on ride, it sounds like homicide
All you marks will know it's the other guys
Gettin' fly while rap is in danger
Six guns, one man, thirty six chambers
Brick city on board like a campaign
And we ain't drinkin' 'less Don is the champagne
Got flows more looser than your spare change
Look dummy, we ain't never in the same lane


Either go hard or go home
You know a nigga like me keeping that chrome
 hittin' my phone
You know a nigga like me'll go hard
I go hard, I go hard, I go hard, I go hard
I go hard, I go hard, I go hard, I go hard


Hey, the same chick I tell you you pop lockin'
That's the same chick you take to go shopping
Young niggas 
Leave 'em talkin' through the box like Troutman
That's why nigga act so hood
I roll up looking at you like "what"
I can't lie but I like to floss

New Eras on,  in motion
Hot chicks love it how I kick it and coach 'em
They'll do whatever, I'm richer than both of 'em
Vegas, I may get eleven on a ocean
Woah, can't do it then allow me
I show y'all a real cannon, body
I yell "Action" no 
And 




Yo, how you gonna find another nigga like me
Even my inner-like me doesn't like me
I'm so cocky wanna mock me
But their styles sloppy like als in ta swap meet
Your barbershops' gettin' faded
Finally the weakest links get eliminated
All you young boys that yellin' out "We made it"
How you gonna create what I 



I'm going hard
