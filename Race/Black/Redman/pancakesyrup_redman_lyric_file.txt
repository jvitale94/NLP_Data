I'm ridin slow with them haters in my rear view
My check here too
My pockets real fat
Two hundred fifty grand, yeah I'm a quarterback
I got them bud and the blunts
Let's pie one
I got them pancakes purple and hawaiian punch
Come on and have lunch
And letch your hair down
Let's move like the six million dollar manow

I said I'm rollin through the hood
Lookin real fly
Everything slow when my car ride by
I'm on that pancake and syrup
I'm on that pancake and syrup

I said I'm rollin through the hood
Lookin real fly
Slow motion girl when my car ride by
I'm on that pancake and syrup
I'm on that pancake and syrup

I love gettin high you can call me an addict
Cause that pancake and syrup I just gotta have it
And I know a lot of people don't know what I mean
That's when you pop a pill then wash it down with some lean
You got it nigga
Now it's chow time
Next destination headed to cloud nine
And I never let a hater try to blow my high
So believe what I'm sayin maaa

I said I'm rollin through the hood
Lookin real fly
Everything slow when my car ride by
I'm on that pancake and syrup
I'm on that pancake and syrup

I said I'm rollin through the hood
Lookin real fly
Slow motion girl when my car ride by
I'm on that pancake and syrup
I'm on that pancake and syrup

Yo, my cadallic roll slow like the grand marshal in the rose bowl
I'm old school
Roach killas you
I'm thinkin old gold, killa
We some fly niggas
Come take this ride with us
That sizzy turn me into godzilla
I'm high as a mothafucka
That pancake and syrup
Keep me higher than black people love pressure
It's runt dawg bitch you already
I had you fools on you too
Eatin vasaline like my crew

I said I'm rollin through the hood
Lookin real fly
Everything slow when my car ride by
I'm on that pancake and syrup
I'm on that pancake and syrup

I said I'm rollin through the hood
Lookin real fly
Slow motion girl when my car ride by
I'm on that pancake and syrup
I'm on that pancake and syrup
