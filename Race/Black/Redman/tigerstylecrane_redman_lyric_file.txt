

Yo, crack the Remy Martin
For niggas pumpin' weed by the mini-market
Bring it when you see me park it
I think big like Diddy office
I fuck a ho with a baseball cap on, like Mr. Marcus
Yeah, my family feud like Richard Dawson
The survey said I'm hot in right in your apartment
This Brick City, right beside New York
Yeah, the streets is watchin' even Mimes wanna talk
I run up on a DJ, smack em' on camera
Makin' sure I get my wax on like Daniel-san
Feel my geniune draft, not filla'
I could walk up in a church a start a Mosh Pit up
Yeah, I bring the pain
11th member of the Wu-Tang, my flow Tiger Style Crane
I'm back nigga, ridin' that Gravy Train
The rap criminal, my artifact is hard to tame
Bitch wanna complain, no use in barkin'
Cause we can go neck-to-neck like Pam and Martin
And smoke like a carton of Newports nigga
On my New Jersey shit, and New York nigga

Check out the nigga flow
I knock out the mic like Buster Douglas, bitch leave a nigga broke
And Jigga know when I clutch the pen it's fuck them hens, I'm puttin' paragraphs in the figure 4
Fuck tryin' to take a pack of protein, cause when I brawl I'm a' be strapped like four ?
Blow smoke rings in the meetin'
If I ain't gettin' half of what I sell you ain't eatin' niether
Our leader won't take no shorts, I know betta'
This D-O-C, MVP for Vendetta
I'm always on point, never skip of slip
My bitch stay tryin' to kill me like Mrs. Smith
If I carry two cannons, no time to pull out
I bust through the side of my jeans like Bruce Banner
My dogs do it on camera, and to them
I'm Big Brother on my ? for Gammafide Gamma
I ride like a rider should
And when a bitch blow Doc she be famous like Monica
Hardcore in the blood, get the best in line
Put the eye into yo' watch cause I'm pressed for time, nigga
