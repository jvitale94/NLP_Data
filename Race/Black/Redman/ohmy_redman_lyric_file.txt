Make her say oh my every time I ride by
She like the way the jet black cadillac shine
(Ma-make her say)  (oh my) 

Yeah yo I hop out my ride I'm lookin fly
Come ride the pony but I'm nuttin like genuine
When benitime was is style I was bendin dimes
Now I'm tryna smoke with Obama at the pentagon
Baby it's been a time and I don't eat beef
I know ya'll niggas smell pussy
But it ain't me
Ya'll should rate me 12 on the richter
Disapear like chappelle on his sista


Make her say oh my every time I ride by she like the way the jet black cadillac shine
(Ma-make her say)  (oh my) 
Make her say oh my every time I ride by she like the way the candy apple cadillac shine
(Ma-make her say)  (oh my) 

Haha yeah yo I hop out my benz
I got my cash on
I'm on that kutch like ashton have some
When I was young it was time for some action
Now I'm grown an primetime (what's hapnun?)
Haha look atcha you on fire
Your toes got the sky hornier than Quagmire
28 on tha tire
Say hi to ya paper
Wave by to them haterz
See em later
Make em say! Oh My!


Make her say oh my every time I ride by she like the way the jet black cadillac shine
(Ma-make her say)  (oh my) 

Ha yeah I pull up to ya
Like what's up with ya
You see the cadillac girl let's cuddle up
I feel great
Baby dontchu life is like chess
Don't make the wrong
Haha but if you do
Don't worry bout it
Il be there like the jacksons
Don't worry bout it
I told my hood
I was gonna do it
Now I'm around the world reppin new wark


Make her say oh my every time I ride by she like the way the jet black cadillac shine (ma-make her say)  (oh my) 
Make her say oh my every time I ride by she like the way the candy apple cadillac shine (ma-make her say)  (oh my)
