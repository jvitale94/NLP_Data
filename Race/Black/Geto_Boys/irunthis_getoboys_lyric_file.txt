


Just put a mic in my hand, I'm comin up with a jam
Conduct a b-boy orchestra, the hip-hop band
So before you start 
Johnny C  cause I run this
Hit it


The Grand Dragon of Rhyme here to blow your mind
Cause I'm a rhythm (fanatic) and I'm one of a kind
Superiority rules cause the king's supreme
I'm cold chillin cause I'm def on the hip-hop scene
My jurisdiction is mine and sucker boys will chill
I'm the latest and the greatest, you know the deal
Juke Box, homeboy, the head of the list
Terminatin all suckers cause I run this
Hit it


It's bein run by me, the Prince of all MC's
Wearin gold cause I'm bold with the rappin disease
Terrorize sucker rappers with these rhymes I wrote
Superior damage unleashed by the case I told
I'm feelin lyrics to display the funky rhymes I say
Opponents better be around when I claim my day
Although my rhyme's complete would you forgive my conceit
And only practice  a true man's beat
Yo, before I start breakin let me stake my place
Holder of a high position, lord of all this bass
Rippin suckers like paper cause they're just that soft
Since I'm killin all rejectin competition (step off)
Supreme rapper with the talent, musical ballad

Microphone occupier, the head of the list
You might not be a sucker but I run this
Hit it


I put fear in your heart with the words I say
Drop suckers by three each and every day
This ain't my callin by law they say
I don't take no shorts, they got to pay
If you swing at me, sucker, don't you miss
You might not be a sucker but I run this
Hit it

Ready Red, break it down
(Tear the roof off)


See we're known from 5th Ward in this world today
In the ghetto of course, but I know my way
I started at the bottom, on the way to the top
Don't allow no cops standin on my block
To all you police who try to diss
You just might be the law but I run this
Hit it


The instrument the turntables used for his benefit
You wanna be like Red, that's why your DJ bit
The cut's created by the master of disaster and me
I'm l-I-v-e, def as could be
 tellin folks that I can't rhyme
You could see my competition, it'll shock you blind
Johnny C the Prince of Rap, lord of all that's writt'
Accompanied by no sucker cause I run this
Hit it


Say yo, baby doll, hear what you say
That you work real hard each and every day
And all I do is sit around
And make you slave like a dumb-ass clown
You buy my clothes, supply the food
But you're the girl and I'm the dude
You take care of me and that is it
You might be my girl but I run this
Hit it
