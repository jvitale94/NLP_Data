


Ha ha ha ha
That's my favorite Malt liquor
Alright!

 Kick that shit

 Who is it?


Yes, it's the S-T crooked I-D-E-S
I make a mess unless
Sucking' through it like a G-O
Ice Cube with G to the E, to the T-O


Now here comes dude
I play the game where there's no rules
Homies on the cut say I'm a fool
Cause I drink brew


Quick to bust a cap on the Ides blow
Bushwick gonna go with the flow
'til the Ides loads


Here I come
Willie D, that's me
Rollin' with 5th Ward, South Park and South Central, Gee
And St. Ides when I party
By the twelve pack case of becardy


A six pack of forty Ack'
Gets the real bounce
I drink brew, but y'all I drink it by the twelve ounce


They say Beer makes fail


But St. Ides is straight, so it really don't matter


So keep eye on the price
Next time go shoppin, grab the St. Ides
And buy the real Malt liquor
And tell them that The Geto Boys and Cube sent ya
