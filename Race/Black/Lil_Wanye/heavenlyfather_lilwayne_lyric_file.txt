I humble myself, as I bow to your throne
Heavenly Father


Before I sleep I pray to the Lord
My soul to keep and if I should die
Before I wake, I pray to the Lord
My soul to take for Goodness sake
Before I sleep I pray to the Lord
My soul to keep and if I should die
Before I wake, I pray to the Lord
My soul to take (Heavenly Father)

Yeah, I wrote my will just the other week
It was funny, it was only one sheet
And I know there's only one me
But I hope I am everything my son needs
I try and live right, stay on the drum beat
But I'm in the fast lane, in the front seat
I wonder, will I lose control of the Maserati
And hit some tree, just being young me?
Is there a heaven for G's and soldiers?
I can't go to hell, cause I'd take over
I feel it approachin' but I ain't scared
I made that bed and I should rest in peace
(Heavenly Father)

Before I sleep I pray to the Lord
My soul to keep and if I should die
Before I wake, I pray to the Lord
My soul to take for Goodness sake
Before I sleep I pray to the Lord
My soul to keep and if I should die
Before I wake, I pray to the Lord
My soul to take (Heavenly Father)

Yeah, and everytime I see the sun shine
I drop down and give thanks at least one time
Feeling like I'm living on the frontline
I'm feeling like every second is crunch time
I've had breakfast, will I make it to lunchtime?
And I ain't joking so don't be looking for punchlines
Will I be the next victim of a gun crime?
I don't know the answer, that's why I brung mine
Riding by myself late at night
Pistol on my lap at every single red light
Yeah, I made my bed right
So when I do I should sleep tight
In peace I rest (Heavenly Father)

Before I sleep I pray to the Lord
My soul to keep and if I should die
Before I wake, I pray to the Lord
My soul to take for Goodness sake
Before I sleep I pray to the Lord
My soul to keep and if I should die
Before I wake, I pray to the Lord
My soul to take (Heavenly Father)

Bury me a gangster cause that's what I live
Don't cry for me I gave the best I could give
I can only do me, so that's what I did
And I cherish every breathe of my kid
And I don't wanna go before she grow, that ain't cool
But in this game of life I don't make the rules
Shit, so that's why I get twisted
So I can't feel it when it hits me
And my moms don't need that owner
But I see death around the corner
And if he, so I just gotta make my way around the block
You gotta answer the door when he knock
(Heavenly Father) Belee that

Before I sleep I pray to the Lord
My soul to keep and if I should die
Before I wake, I pray to the Lord
My soul to take for Goodness sake
Before I sleep I pray to the Lord
My soul to keep and if I should die
Before I wake, I pray to the Lord
My soul to take for Goodness sake (Heavenly Father)
