


They've been wondering if I'm gonna show
Shit you already know-ow-ow-ow
Where you been? where you at? where you headed?
This shit started to disappear oh no, no
I'm right here, yeah, take this shit right back to the basics
Sound like I'm right back in the basement
Tryna to put my neighborhood on
Six in the morning, six in the morning
Until six in the morning, best believe I'm on it
Man I'm working so hard
When the check hit the bank, shit, I ain't even notice
I live in the future, I'm blind to the moment
I, I, you ain't gotta stay
Oh you ain't gotta stay around we own it


I remember when I was young just a front runner
I was fucking with them drums like every summer
Homie couldn't make it out the hood, make a nigga wonder
But I couldn't let Compton take a nigga under
No way, no how, can't stop
Had, bigger dreams for this hip-hop
I'm happy, it was music and not Ziplocs
And now we, bringing crowds like it's woodstock
I might as well wipe down the crown I done put up in the attic
I don't play around, lotta niggas coming through the door
Not too many stay around
Lot of artists made it yeah
God damn man I made a sound
Oh you ain't never seen a legend do it?
Hold up homie wait around
I've been on the verge since a nigga put it down
If we talking numbers, fuck Billboard charts
Putting for start with the bank accounts


I've been away
But I think I'm doing better
Anything you do can't impress us
I won't let up on it
What are you gonna say
And I think because they hate us
And the fact that they can't break us
I will never let up
I'm going, yeah I'm going
Best believe I'm going
I'm going back
It's time to get back to business


This shit realer than rap
Somewhere trapped where you can find me at
Got thirteen in my strap
And I kick it, do it with me whatever town we at
I'm killing these niggas was never feeling these niggas
Went from a million to ten figures I grow
Getting back to the business in the back of a Bentley
I'm thinking damn how far can I go
Well, if my nigga Dre can get a bill
It let me know that there's hope for a nigga still
And many more showing love for my art form
When the ATL the trap shit was on board
Give a raw nigga money when they let me in
If it wasn't for me they would have let me sit
Explanation for all the demolition we did
I'm grinding handling my business nigga


How many miles in the air
One million I'm stacking up this paper
Up up and away-er
One way ticket to the ozone layer
Don't you wanna roll where there ain't no head room
Take it to another atmosphere


Smoke this, smoke this
Roll it up, roll it up, get a lighter
Smoke this
Roll it up, roll it up, get a lighter
Another atmosphere
I can change your atmosphere
Get a girl for my Johnson
Roll it up, smoke this
Break it down, roll it up, get a lighter
Smoke this, roll it up, get a lighter
I can change your atmosphere
Smoke this
