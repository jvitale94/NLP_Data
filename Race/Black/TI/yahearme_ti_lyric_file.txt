Yeah
Ay
Ay
That's right


Hopping out a drop appla'
Pants hanging to my ankles
Feel 'em hate from every angle
They intimidating ain't I
I'm a beast,
They don't like to see me walking outta prison
I ain't trippen I don't owe 'em nothing but a Ass Whipping
What you looking at
Girl, you better cut the television on
Don't want us on your ass, best to get the getting on...
Homes,
I way known your if you want it
I ain't gotta go for bad, I just go for my opponent
I ain't looking for no trouble I ain't ducking none neither
Say a nigga jumping ship, I say so fuck 'em I don't need 'em
Still greet 'em with the same smile like I used to
Get wild if you choose to I ain't finna shoot shoot
End up, head buss, bleedy no loose tooth
Whoop a nigga ass by his self or with a group too
Who? Fight back, hoe, it's like that
Where my knife at? Shawty I be right back.


Fresh out the box I'm a mash out
(your hear me?)
This year a hunned mill I'm a cash out
(your hear me?)
Today a 100k ain't none brag about
(your hear me?)
The king pull it right,
Big bank take little bank
Fresh out the box I'm a mash out
(your hear me?)
This year a hunned mill I'm a cash out
(your hear me?)
Today a 100k ain't none brag about
(your hear me?)
Rolling through your hood,
Can your hear me now? Good.


We gonna do it big like we did before
Fresh off of Kay,
ASAP, Motivation Hoe
Guess that's all it take
I got they ass with my poker face
Wait, till they get a load of me like the joker say (hahahaha)
A lot of time that bullshit we'll past but ain't today
Gonna be a (cold red, man down) like Frankie say ay
At the layer where the players meet
All squares kick rocks with you're bare feet bitches cherish me
King back, nigga raise up...
It's safe to say them suckers wanna see me caged up
That chapter's over pass the mic, and set the stage up
Throw your A up, tell my p.o I don't blaze up, pee wee fire the haze up
They prise us, 'cause old heads recognize the G in him
Black card no limit like p and them
Ain't nobody seeing him, who fucking with shawty them.
We pull up, bitches yell out OMG just like my daughter them.

I'm in a jet black camera, with me eyes on a spare
They say I can't have no pistol so I bought a bow and arrow
Just wait, niggas saying it ain't the same and I get back
See ain't a damn thing change but my 6-pac
You want reck, you can get that
But all the disrespecting shawty I ain't with that
Parta I ain't finna chit chat,
Coming from when a nigga had to break 'em off a piece
Like a Kit Kat
Tell them kats bless me to impress me
Best leave or get wet like a jet ski
Overseas where you catch me
When they holla king nigga they don't mean Elvis Presley
Hard lumped up
Chest like a dump truck
Keep the sword on me, shawty this ain't what you want brah
I ain't gotta buss your, if you close enough you getting stuck
Leave a nigga dripping like a sippie cup (pick 'em up)
