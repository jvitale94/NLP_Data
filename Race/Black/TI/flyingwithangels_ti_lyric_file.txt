Gotta live life, cus the day you die
No flashing lights, this life has a price
And I'm feelin, I'm feelin

And man who can say one say I
Won't run the streets, I wouldn't get high
Not today and this a matter what the fuck shit man
Nigga tryin me out with the hot shit man
If you tryna get down, make a deal with the maker
We'll show you firsthand how we deal with a hater
Killers out there'll have to live with it later
Shoot him in the head and deal with it later
Man he's made up, fit to them
Guess I'm only waitin only I'mma get to them
Hatin ass nigga don't mention them
But please don't mention what we did to them
Nigga you know how we do and we do all
Step through, I put the fire, it'll be more tall
And like your life on the line whenever we talk
If you say the wrong thing it could be yo loss
I'mma do a kick play in a major way
Nigga that's real
Smoke and think about how I'mma get paid today
Won't stop, can't rest til I'm major paid
If I die today then I die smiling
Nigga, no lie
Because I live every day of my life like a night life
K so we good about it

I can feel on the tip of my fingers
There's no lie, man I'm so high
I feel like I've been sleepin with angels
Gotta live life, cus the day you die
Every day the true become famous
No flashing lights, this life has a price
And I can feel on the tip of my fingers
And I feel it, I feel it

Now I ain't sayin that I'm famous but the streets feel like I made it
Come to Alabama, where they treat me like I'm savin
Bet my mama still on that same block
Ridin round in that same car
Getting harassed by the same cops
Feeling like I'm bout the rain drops
I mean haven't got a pot to piss in til I got a pot to cool bricks in
And I got a couple rich friends who feelin like I'm switching friends
Boy a nigga say anything
Niggas say a nigga changed
Feel like a cartoon wardrobe, I swear to God I'm still the same
Come on feel my pain, going through so much
And while it's "fuck the fame", shit, where's the love?
I can't leave these streets â€” I can't lose my plug
If rap don't work for me, I'm back to sellin' drugs.
Havin hopes, cashin dubs
Same will say, match it up
Cus shit, I'm through to go back to that shit
And while I'm getting tied to my niggas' riches
Money make it for better bitch
I'm so close I can smell on my eyes and I see clearly

I can feel on the tip of my fingers
There's no lie, man I'm so high
I feel like I've been sleepin with angels
Gotta live life, cus the day you die
Every day the true become famous
No flashing lights, this life has a price
And I can feel on the tip of my fingers
And I feel it, I feel it
