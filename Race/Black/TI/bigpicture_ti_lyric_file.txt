I see the big picture I know 
On everything I love I'm the shit and I know 
To do it big I gotta keep em out my business I know 
Because these niggas like to gossip like the bitches I know 
I finally get it now 
I see the big picture I know 
On everything I love I'm the shit and I know 
I run this city, wish that wasn't my position I know 
These niggas softer than the pussies and the bitches I know 


Aye 
What it is big dog? I know I'm the shit cause I bounce back 
Totally recover from a pit fall 
Don't make you a fighter just because you got your fist balled 
Its get right and get paid or good night and get lost 
Bitches talk big shit even when my dick soft 
Everyday my birthday, they just wanna get they licks off 
Rocket ship lift off, come sit on my launch pad 
G5, mile high, group sex, jet lag 
Boullion, checks, cash, millions, just ask 
Even if you hate me, surely you respect that 
Yeah, you're now rockin with the best dad 
Chicks see me I be like "look at T.I. with his zig-zags" 
Wishin they could take a ride on my moustache 
Or maybe see the inside of my plush pad 
But I must pass, I know what you on homie 
Up late one night early morning and hey, it dawned on me and 




Love my mutha fuckin life 
I'm so mutha fuckin tight 
They say "he think he the shit" 
I say "you mutha fuckin right" 
Teach a mutha fuckin dyke to learn to love suckin pipe 
Buses, cars, trucks and bikes in my yard 
up the price of my performance 
now I'm goin for a half a mil' a night 
quarter million just to party 
if you gossip get it right 
niggas shiest 
but I know somethin if I put end a nigga life 
its gonna begin a nigga trip to god and end a nigga life 
Man I keep it one hundred, one thousand to be precise 
If you round me frontin go find a mountain and take a hike 
Yeah I know you set your sights on me, tryin to get stripes 
Homie look smaller but feel bigger in real life, don't he? 
I'm all that and more, ain't nothin bout the hype for me 
I'm sharing life moments, ain't nobody write for me 
You a one trick pony, I'm quadruple threat homie 
Up late 4 in the mornin and hey, it dawned on me and 




I'm clearly somethin special, officially I'm the best who 
Did it in my city and even in the U.S, you 
Must agree, they cant fuck with me, I'ma beast unless you, 
Hatin, you ain't gotta be sneezin for me to bless you 
If the records don't get you, I bet the movie will get you 
??...will catch your attention, I'ma impress you 
With swagger long term, Hollywood bitches to tag along 
Groupies just imagine on, they know what I'm braggin on 
I gotta message you can pass along, tell a friend 
We getting long paper jay, we made it back from hell again 
Knockin on heaven's door, residing there forever more 
Promoters, this worth every cent, you couldn't buy a better tour 
And you are forced to admire the messiah 
Expressin your desire, you're just preachin to the choir 
The nation has it wired to hear your majesty, sire 
I'm flyin high up one mornin and hey, it dawned on me and
