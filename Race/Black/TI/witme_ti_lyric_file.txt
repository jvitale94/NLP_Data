Put my work in yo pussy, bitch don't come on a word
Pass the weed to your slime, these niggas greener than lime
So many knots in my pockets, the bitch need a massage
I was born in the drought, I hope I die in yo mouth
If you're a rat you should've died as a mouse
The weed louder than the opera house, 'til the fat lady sings
Drop codeine in my punch, I'm 'bout to take a swing
If niggas thinkin' I'm soft, I'll knock yo thinkin' cap off
I get blood out these pussies, I'm a stinking tampon
This for my niggas back home, I'm still New Orleans regardless
Got bitches fallin' like august, can sell that bullshit to a tourist
My bitch is badder than me, call that Adam & Eve
I do tricks on my skateboard, not up my sleeve
I kiss yo bitch on the neck, shoot your man in the head
Hit his mama address then send his parents his head
I play with pussy, not these niggas
Crucify these niggas
Kidnap 'em call their boss so ask 'em who gon' buy these niggas
Got Lil Wayne on her ass, Lil Tunechi on her titties
To kill me you gotta die wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me
(Wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)


We ain't playin', got 100 racks (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)
In the van got 100 gats (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)
Streets (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)
She's (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)
He's (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)
(I'm wit you!)
We ain't playin', got 100 racks (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)
In the van got 100 gats (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)
Strong (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)
Gas (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)
Drank (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)


I ain't never been dumb my nigga
Or sucka neither, go ahead play around wit it
Cash on deck, they be layin' round wit it
Gotta cake up, where the suckas playin' rounds wit it
I'm cold, don't believe me, just ask yo bitch
I swear she know her legs up high
She spread eagle and then took in my big ego
I'm stupid, ask Tunechi and them
Let me tell you a little something 'bout me
I talk shit, break like Muhammad Ali
Damn, whoop a nigga ass like Muhammad Ali
I'm thrown, no catchin' me
These niggas in the game â€“ so sad to me
I'm sure no one would care we
Just put them out their misery
But no sympathy and no green, uh uh
Leave home with no heat, uh uh
Can nigga talk bullshit of records and see 'em in public
And they never do nothing
You violator, demonstrations I'ma
Put niggas up under, wherever we want
I got racks in my pocket right next to my lamas
I'm mowin' my bag, the purple mohana
Get after my girl and it's round whatever
So don't be struck down when you seein' me nigga
Whoever fuck with me be smoking the Sadie
You ready for war, you 'bout that like really
You catch me in Cali, you catch me in Phily
See me in Miami, the coppers is wit me
Don't kick no niggas who be gossippin' with me
Lookin' for yo bitch but she probably (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)


We ain't playin', got 100 racks (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)
In the van got 100 gats (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)
Streets (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)
She's (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)
He's (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)

Uh, pussy money weed with me
Before you judge me I plead guilty
I wish a nigga would, I won't get a splinter
Just bought a chicken, 'bout to break it down into chicken tenders
This block booming, I'm not human
My drop zoomin', my eyes groomin'
One giant leap for mankind
I'm high as moon men, how have you been?
Gun ain't on my waist
But it ain't that far away
I'm sparkling like some Chardonnay
Here today, gone today
I play with pussy, not these niggas
Crucify these niggas
Kidnap 'em call their boss so ask 'em who gon' buy these niggas
Got Lil Wayne on her ass, Lil Tunechi on her titties
To kill me you gotta die wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me


Hey Wayne wait man, these niggas ain't true
Julio on the yard, these niggas can't do
These niggas ain't King, these niggas ain't Tune
Got the game locked up, covered every angle
Got the outside, inside, middle lane too
All sold up nigga, hold up nigga
Pimps on the loop, put yo hoes up nigga
Handcuff that bitch when we roll up nigga
We'll hit that bitch come pull up
Hair head and shoulders up cover hole up in here
With the legs hanging out, is she dead? Just about
Then we rollin' some loud and leave up out the house
We leave up the house, counting 100's and 50's
And go do a show for 250
We sell out arenas at hundreds of cities
These niggas want trouble? I'm bringing it with me


We ain't playin', got 100 racks (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)
In the van got 100 gats (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)
Streets (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)
She's (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)
He's (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)
(I'm with you!)
We ain't playin', got 100 racks (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)

No, they ain't fuckin' wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me

Ahhh!
My bad I didn't mean to scream.
Sorry
