I make this G shit look so easy to do, 
And when you see me salute commander and chief conceiling the truth 
It don't matter wether the streets or the booth. 

When you see me salute 
And when you see me salute 
When you see me salute 
You ain't gotta speak homie when you see me salute. 

Raise your right hand to your hairline 
Stand that attention hold it there until you're recognized 
Once I return the salutation then is at ease as if you heard no conversation 
Well, and lets just sayin' what it do g 
Decorated 5 star general a true G 
Made it fresher off the battlefield 
Rip it for my niggas in the battle still 
Yea with more stripes then a jail suit 
Been in the need, trail oop 
When I fail, through bitches standin their cells 
Takin pictures wit their cells 
And let me tell you sutin 'bout a playa 
Put me anywhere in any jail 
And I shall prevail 
And if another man survived I shall as well 
Now fuck rap got swag for sale 
You crossed my path in air brazil 

Ay when you see me, salute me like a general I'm leading the troops 
I make this G shit look so easy to do, 
And when you see me salute commander and chief conceiling the truth 
It don't matter wether the streets or the booth. 

When you see me salute 
And when you see me salute 
When you see me salute 
You ain't gotta speak homie when you see me salute. 

Hot stain from the nonsense 
Remain conscious 
The idiots make idiotic comments 
A convict wit a conscious 
You lack mores I can see your principles 
And not my mines is 
So I guess what makes me special 
Just to get from the curse 
Like shit to get you rich at first 
So put your dick in the dirt 
That's why I don't gotta be the greatest of all time 
As long as I keep it real in my rhymes I'm fine 
I ain't lying 
Give me mine and I'm satisfied 
I'm just happy I got to make before my daddy died 
And all things considered 
Everytime destiny calls I can deliver 
Not illa a young heart wit a old soul 
Some hot holes and a cold flow 
And as far as keepin it real go 
Home when you need me 
Don't forget the proper way to greet me 

Ay when you see me, salute me like a general I'm leading the troops 
I make this G shit look so easy to do, 
And when you see me salute commander and chief conceiling the truth 
It don't matter wether the streets or the booth. 

When you see me salute 
And when you see me salute 
When you see me salute 
You ain't gotta speak homie when you see me salute.
