With your ass hoe
Get embarrassed hoe
All about my cash flows
Yo new bitch was my last hoe
I got 6 sluts in my maybach
Six pack under my tank top
I got a snub nose that got 6 shots
Nigga try me, I think not
My temper bad I might blink out
Buss a nigga before I can even think about
What I got to lose
If he busts a move
Well I got to do what I got to do
Trap rollin, bumpin
Always sellin somethin
We got it if you want it
Its whatever for the money on my grind 
They in line for the product from a dime up
They know where to find us
Do you know what its time for?
