Smile, I'm picture perfect
Got my jewelery shining
Thats a Kodak moment
Call me Mr. Kodak you know I'm stayin' focused
Life is like a photograph
Get money is my slogan


You must be camera shy, I'm paparazzi prone
They flashin' I'm the main attraction, need no microphone
Wide screen me, get your High Definition on
Everytime you see me my neck and wrist glisten homes
Sittin' on, big bank
I'm sober dawg, but your bitch aint
Yellow watch yellow chain drippin', piss stains
Tipple lane know that Kodak couldnt picture this


Call me Mr Kodak
Smile, I'm picture perfect
Got my jewelery shining
Thats a Kodak moment
Call me Mr. Kodak you know I'm stayin' focused
Life is like a photograph
Get money is my slogan

High definition and when I come around
See the cameras flick up when I'm in your town
Cal me Mr Kodak
Smile, I'm picture perfect
Got my jewelry shinnin' its a Kodak moment


Ay the King here, see me clear, megapixels
For real nigga, try me, get erased like a pencil
And until a nigga kill me I'ma shine on (shine on)
You can have whatever light, just give me mine homes
I get my grind on like I'm dead broke
I swear man I'm so money hungry till my head hurt
Respect my evolution, check your resolution
Leave the apartment, red carpet ready, get camera shootin'




On your Q's and your P, boy, you better be
Gon need a dark room to develop me
My pedigree (pedigree) is hella G (is hella g)
20 Mill, bitch aint nothin' you could tell a G
God damn cauliflower, celery
All about my Brussels sprouts, you better tell them C
Overseas I go Brazil, Monaco, Belize
Camera notice like you wont believe




Yeah, Mr TMZ himself, haha, yeah
Access Hollywood, nigga I access your Hollywood
You understand that? ah huh
Look at me man, front page man, you know what I'm sayin'
You can check me standin' tall holmes
Get your wide screen on
You know what I'm sayin', upgrade your resolution man
High definition required, you dig that? yea
You need 3d glasses to see me nigga!
