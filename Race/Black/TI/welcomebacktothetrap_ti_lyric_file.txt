King shit right here nigga (dat‘s right)…Grand hustle right here nigga (dat‘s right)…
You don’t like it steer clear nigga… Zone one Bankhead nigga (Center Hill)
Diss what they waitin’ on… IT’S DA KING BITCH


Sacks on my draw show
Walkin’ through the mall blow
20 30 racks yeah I’ll hav dat also
Further mo niggas cant see me like waldo
Yall so sick in the head if u even thought so 
I’m nine years in it six of which I been all flow
Tryin’ T.I suicide like it’s car door
I’m gettin’ big bread homie only getting’ small dough 
I’m all dat and u ain’t even all more
Hoes say I got the big head  cause a big dick
Don’t believe if I say it go and ask his bitch (she’ll tell it)
Say she never seen stacks this thick a king of oneself
Outfits to match his kicks
Streetcred up to here
And swag trough the roof
Go Google Clifford Harris if yo ass need poof
Plague allegiance the swag
No, I don’t mean to brag but I do
And u just mad cause it’s true  
 

Welcome back to the trap and back to the grind
I’m back on my hustle with an illmacular shine
Welcome back to the trap and back to the street 
Homie right after I’m released see me right back with the heat
Welcome back to the trap and back to the grind
I’m back on my hustle with an illmacular shine
Welcome back to the trap I’m back on my shit
Diss da shit dat you missing come get right back on my dick


All they do is motive these rappers I can procreate 
No debate, thinking it was over for me yo mistake
Vokas  pay very close attention to what brokers say
Notice they way beneath my level they suppose to hate
Over they, heads so high flow by lil guy couldn’t reach if he try no lie
And I’m, so fly with no feathers, parachute, or propellers grab it is so jealous 
Care if clown wanna see me fall down (no fellas)
What does history tell us? By now u should know better
Spell my name with the same 4 letters 
I’ma raim forever better get a umbrella nigga
I suggest you respect my grind must follow one rule let T.I. shine 
And I’m, never leaving you just have to adapt 
Right now let me welcome you back to the trap


Welcome back to the trap and back to the grind
I’m back on my hustle with an illmacular shine
Welcome back to the trap and back to the street 
Homie right after I’m released see me right back with the heat
Welcome back to the trap and back to the grind
I’m back on my hustle with an illmacular shine
Welcome back to the trap I’m back on my shit
Diss da shit dat you missing come get right back on my dick (A welcome back to the trap!!!)
