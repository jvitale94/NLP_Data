Disrespect will not be disregarded partna 
You cross dat line I'm goin' off bout mine 
Man woman and child, no exception home boy 
no disrespect will be tolerated come hell or high water 
You understand that? Ya bitch! 
Bankroll mafia, hustle gang ova everythang nigga 
 
I got fake bitches on my timeline 
Sucka niggas in my rearview 
Wonder why I'm even wasting my time 
Even replying to letcha know I don't feel you 
Fuck 'em! 
Dodging nothin' but a Fed case 
Betta know it, tired of holdin' on to dead weight 
Goin' let it go 
Ain't no turnin' round lookin' back 
I Swear to God I'ma drop a gem like cookin' crack 
And sell it hard 
I'ma, Bankhead nigga to the heart 
Tote tools on the boulevard 
Its young niggas in a stolen car 
With expensive ambition and exquisite pistols we showin’ off 
Caught that line and we goin’ off 
And let his mom give a damn, who you goin’ call? 
You violatin, we ain’t lettin’ nothin’ go at all 
We demonstrate and leave your brains on the fuckin' wall 
Puss, you disrespectful nigga, got that 
I ain’t neva been shot at, and I ain't shot back 
Bossed up in a cool whip with a hot gat 
And still got stacks from back from “What You Know About That?” 
 

I’m just a project nigga on the front steps 
And gettin’ money is the concept 
By any means, and the belt where the gun kept 
I let that whole clip ride, till ain’t one left in it 
Try me, I'ma handle my business, handle my business 
Try me, I'ma handle my business 
Try me I'ma handle my business, try me 
 
I got fake bitches in my timeline 
Hatin' niggas in my rearview 
I got naked bitches in the high rise 
On the balcony so they could get a clear view 
Of the city with my dick up in it 
But in the morning won’t remember which bitch is it, shit 
Ay I’m too rich for this shit but I’m too real to be tried nigga 
Going against me just like goin’ against God 
And I ain’t gotta make excuses 
I don't fuck whoever, whatchu wanna do about it 
Thought not, fuck around get crossed out 
You caught slippin' roll down on your ass, .45 start spittin' 
Goin' be a long day nigga I start trippin' 
Don’t be stickin' to the script, drive-by audition, wassup 
Whatchu do for dough, guess you do it too slow 
And by the looks of your stuff, you ain’t doin' enough 
I’m poppin' witnesses in the front, leave you in the dust 
Kick in your door masked up like, “Who in the fuck?” 
Boy you a ho ho, not just a little piece of pussy 
Betta watch your ass talkin', you don't me nigga holdup 
 

I’m just a project nigga on the front steps 
And gettin’ money is the concept 
By any means, and the belt where the gun kept 
I let that whole clip ride, til ain’t one left in it 
Try me, I'ma handle my business, handle my business 
Try me, I'ma handle my business 
Try me I'ma handle my business, try me 
 
All I wanna do is go and chill 
Take my mind off the ones I wanna go and kill 
Yea, I’m a daddy, love my little girls 
But I’ll still check a bitch like ‘Pac did Lauryn Hill 
Hey I ain’t grow into it, I was born with it 
Used to sell crack to the children of the corn 
I’m the reason why your mama warned you 
Pray you don’t die before you make it to the street corner 
 

I’m just a project nigga on the front steps 
And gettin’ money is the concept 
By any means, and the belt where the gun kept 
I let that whole clip ride, til ain’t one left in it 
Try me, I'ma handle my business, handle my business 
Try me, I'ma handle my business 
Try me I'ma handle my business, try me!
