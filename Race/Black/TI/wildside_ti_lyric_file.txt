Riding chrome
Only thing I've ever known
Is walk on the wildside
Welcome to our lives

Swagging keys
Spraying K's
Every day we getting paid
To walk on the wildside
Welcome to our lives


Come take a little walk with me through my neighborhood
And come spend a day in my trap
Get your paper right
If that yay some good
But just keep a tool in your lap
My lil patna holding that work
Nigga won't wait we keep around back
Bet not violate on my turf
Nigga this the days you a die like that
(Hey, no)
Investigation no statements
No witnesses, we ain't seen shit
Pull up after dark
With that jewelry on
To come see a bitch
That way he get it
We on dark road, with no street lights
That pistol play after fist fights
N'em geek monster walk all night
With they crack pipe trying to get right
Midnight we shoot dice
The whole house smell like cooked crack
You beat me, and you talk shit
You get shot bitch, and I took that
Hoodrats on deck, that loud as all I blow
This shit to you might sound wild
But this life is all I know


Smoking weed
Riding chrome
Only thing I've ever known
Is walk on the wildside
Welcome to our lives

(Hey)
Can you picture me back in 93'
Bumpin' it out with Dre
While I hit some weed
Cut school, make ten G
Thirteen, trying to get ki
At fifteen, I was full-grown
Get wrong, get bust on
My uncle gave me a bunch of work
And that shit was gone by the next mornin'
You wild nigga runnin' with me
Homicide wasn't nothin' to us
Dead body wasn't nothin' to see
That pistol play was just fun to us
I was 19 with two felonies
One of my best friends have a life sentence
All my other friends, was just like me
Had a bunch of partnas no longer living
All about that cocaine dealing
And no education, no pot to piss in
Old school, on chrome wheel
Windows tinted, pistol hidden
That's the shit that I come from
In my heart, fear ain't none
Stand tall, I can't run from
That wildside, that I smoke on


Smoking weed
Riding chrome
Only thing I've ever known
Is walk on the wildside
Welcome to our lives

(Uh)
(Yeah)
All I ever did was pit on
All my old friends tryin' to get on
So they fell out, makin' dis songs
Never talk down when I get home
Ain't the type of nigga you can shit on
Unexpose, brick chrome
Guard body, big bone
That's hard body, Jim Jones
Nigga's know the sound on how we switch on him
Finna wild out on a tip song
Better make a toast, nigga, tip home
First get the bread, then you get gone
From the land of the land where they spit chrome
With most kids never get to live long
If they pissed off, they get pissed on
Pistolwhipped and stripped, homie
Left for a minute and they switched on me
Caught them talking down, turnin' bitch on me
And they snitch on me
They got shit, on me
So my guess is death is what they wish, on me
So I'm Blowing on them candles, closed lids and dark eyes
Kuz hates never part time when you on that wild side
