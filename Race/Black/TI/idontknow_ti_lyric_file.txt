(I don't know what the fuck
Or what you think nigga
This ain't that nigga!
For real!)
I wonder what my kids would think about me
(Damonie, King, Major, Messiah, Déjà, Neke Neke)
Yeah, Aye Aye


Now I don't know whatchu been told about me
(I don't know what you thought but the real is)
But I don't take no shit from no nigga
(And all niggas, no exceptions homeboy)
And I wonder what my kids a think about me
If I went to jail
(If I had to, would you love me)
Cause I had to kill me a nigga


Aye I'm hoping for the best tryna dodge the stress
But sometimes that just ain't the way dat it go
Hey if a nigga pull up on me at the light and it's a choppa in site
Felon or not bet I be lettin it go
I gotta make it back home
Major need me to cut his cartoons on
My baby Déjà catchin feelins bout er'ythang she sensitive
And King love money
I need to show him how to get it den
Damonie need me to tell em
"You wanna rap den take it serious den"
Plaything it neva been
All I did was get it in
Neke Neke need a nigga to know what a real nigga is
Messiah need me to show him how I broke a deal
So imagine if I went and got killed
Get real nigga
And you know everyday we out here in the field
Gettin it how we live
Fuck a record deal
Put my money with yo money
All we do is get mo money
But you know what I gotta do when someone tryta take it from me now


Now I don't know whatchu been told about me
(I don't know what you thought but the real is)
But I don't take no shit from no nigga
(And all niggas, no exceptions homeboy)
And I wonder what my kids a think about me
If I went to jail
(If I had to, would you love me)
Cause I had to kill me a nigga


Disrespect me and we have to shoot it out in the street
Fuck it that's just how dat shit have to be
I gotta drum on da C
So the carpet spit 50 at least
Message to all who wanna see me deceased
Come and get you a piece
You think I'm poutin nigga
Slice me and eat
Boy ain't went one day out my life I was sweet
Except for to her
See she need me to keep it Coutoure
And buy her all the fancy shit she prefer
She ain't get it doh
But you gotta play yo part for a nigga doh
Fuck a bitch stay away from dem niggas doh
Cause you gon have me kickin in a nigga doe
Wavin pistols fuck you nigga
Bitch go get yo shit let's go
Or do you need me to let you go
Find a rich nigga buy a house so I can move next doe
Sit dere and watch yo new husband as he pull out da garage
Watch you tip toe in dat doe so I can kill you den run
You so impressed with dem niggas
You know dis ain't no faćade
I'll pull my tech on dem niggas
And get em closer to God
You say I find the worst in er'ythang I see
But I love hard
That's somethin you know about me
Girl you know about me Aye


Now I don't know whatchu been told about me
(I don't know what you thought but the real is)
But I don't take no shit from no nigga
(And all niggas, no exceptions homeboy)
And I wonder what my kids a think about me
If I went to jail
(If I had to, would you love me)
Cause I had to kill me a nigga

You know what I'm sayin
I know I had a lotta fucked up shit go on in my life
And this shit gotdamn
It's in my head and in my heart man
It ain't on me, it's in me
You know what I'm sayin
And And maybe I haven't
Developed enough
To where I can communicate
In a way that'll keep me
From doing somethin that'll
Trip my life off the streets my nigga
So if separation is da best
Den I respectfully say I love you to gotdamn death
And all my children
If I have to dome me a nigga out here
Please just come see me man
When you can man
Lemme see my grand kids
But I'll be GOTdamned
If a mf'a take you from me man
I put my mf'n life on that
Kill or be killed nigga.
