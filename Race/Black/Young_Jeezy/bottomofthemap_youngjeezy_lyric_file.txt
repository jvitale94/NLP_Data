got a 50 round clip on the bottom of the strap
ay 
I do it for the trappers with the-the-the rocks
and them ole G niggas with the the the blocks
ay 


I'm strapped up, I'm iced out
a nigga play, it's lights out
cost a cool quarter million, that's how you'll find me
swirvin through traffic with them goons behind me
you better call you crew, you're gonna need help
hole car strapped and I ain't talking seat belts
red cross nigga, yeah we draw blood
hole team got choppers like a bike club
I don't get mad, I just get money
and laugh at these fuck niggas 'cause they're so funny
all a gangsta do is stay fresh
45 with the Gucci Teflon vest




I'm on fire the kids outta controll
competition want me to stop, drop and roll
like I got a flame thrower and some gasoline
set the city on fire thas on everything
I walk around like I got a grip in my pants
yeah thas about 10 stacks got half a brick in my pants
fish scale got papi on speed dial
you niggas getting raped you're still getting oil base
my flow is bananas, the coop is grape
these Evisu Jeans with the Bathin' Apes
dessert on the pillow choppers on the night stand
you can roll the dice play with your life man




all that tough talk you just wasting you breath
hit you ass with them things have you chasing you breath
you got loose lips..you better put a collar on 'em
black chenelle frames I spent a couple dollars on 'em
Whole zip of kush just to get my mind right,
Gresham Rd. see 'Dawun' get my sound right.
mah money come fast so thas how I spit it
trunk sounding like it got a marchin band in it
you in the minor leagues, and I'm a heavy weight
flipping brick houses, we call it real estate
5 thousand by the pound get you curb serviced
sell a lot of grass like I got a lawn service
