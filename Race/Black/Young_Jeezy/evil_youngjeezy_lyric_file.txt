If you said fuck me now I won't even be surprised
Everybody ain't real and I had to realize
That you hating ass nigga, just a devil in disguise
Don't see no evil, hear no evil
Catch me ridin dolo I got 2 dessert eagles
Don't see no evil, hear no evil
Catch me out shining, I got 2 dessert eagles

Stevie J face on you pussy niggas, I'm focused
Grab a sledgehammer about to crush 'em all, they roaches
Young'll have them niggas hunt your ass down like poachers
Have them looking for your ass in broad day they roaches
Y'all what the fuck's with all the hate I see
I'll tell you pussy niggas to your face, can't beat me
Real nigga all day every day, that's Jeezy
Got love for this hip hop shit, that's mimi
Nigga I can feel the hate in the air, I smell it
Fuck you mean what I know about hope I sell it
Dear God protect me from these demon niggas, they evil
Why you think them streets praying for you nigga, they need you


I know you aiming for me I can see it in your eyes
If you said fuck me now I won't even be surprised
Everybody ain't real and I had to realize
That you hating ass nigga, just a devil in disguise
Don't see no evil, hear no evil
Catch me riding dolo I got 2 dessert eagles
Don't see no evil, hear no evil
Catch me out shining, I got 2 dessert eagles

You niggas want me over like movie credits, I know it
All that real nigga shit you niggas talking, I'm for it
Nigga as long as I got air in my lungs I'm grounded
Lord how you came back to save these niggas good timing
Notice anythang different about my watch no diamonds
Grown men shit on you little niggas still shining
Tell you one thing I learned about life keep moving
Drunk a whole half a gallon last night I'm ruined
Niggas worried about you and ain't worried 'bout they self that's backwards
Man half these niggas ain't even theyself they actors
Nigga everything I learn in the streets, is with me
Niggas don't like the way a nigga eat, come get me


I know you aiming for me I can see it in your eyes
If you said fuck me now I won't even be surprised
Everybody ain't real and I had to realize
That you hating ass nigga, just a devil in disguise
Don't see no evil, hear no evil
Catch me riding dolo I got 2 dessert eagles
Don't see no evil, hear no evil
Catch me out shining, I got 2 dessert eagles
