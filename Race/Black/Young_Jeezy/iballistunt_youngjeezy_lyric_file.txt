Got a whole bunch of niggas that would deal with ya

Good 50 on the cane, make a nigga day
Eachother go dum like I’m 
No lie game Obama’s little brief
We go on all the goons give ‘em all Rozay
Rollin’ up kush we gon’ blow all day
Quickly check the home better know your pain
Money in my pocket, money in the stage
And when we hit the club we throw in money and the fame

Standing on the couch with me and my litter
Don’t lie the game we all been here
