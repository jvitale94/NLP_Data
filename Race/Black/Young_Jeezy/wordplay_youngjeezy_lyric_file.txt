Young bounce right back like a rubberband
Bought a whip look yall

Topless stop this 
Whereâs your roof?
All this non sense
Thereâs no you
Married to the game

Used to bet on all hip-hop
Young killed hip-hop
Donât you know this dumb nigga still talking crack rocks
Got everybody following him
Does that make him a leader?
Does that mean he needs to get indicted
Just to make you a believer
If thatâs the case 
Then i really do apoligize
That i memorize 
That i fantasized
That i visualized
That i strategize
1 false move will get your ass penalized
You cant be serious
What if pac was hearing this
You bullshiting me
Iâm sure biggie would agree
If he had to pass the torch
Then that bitch would go to me
Now wouldnât you agree
It doesnât matter how he said it

Caught in the black grass

A round of applause

Try to break that nigga
