Hundred brawlers in a club at one time, ain't shit to me
So tonight everything's on me, this is victory

They like god damn young, nigger where that album at
Niggas talking like he fell off, just imagine that
Know anything about young he aint havin' that
Flip a 20 another 20 more he an acrobat
Think I came all this way so yall can doubt nigger?
Took them road trips whole thangs so y'all can doubt a nigger?
Who you think count the money up, the rubber band clan
Put it in the Chevy turn the tops, the rubber band man

Counting in my man's apartment, in his living room
Paper all on the TV, need some living room

Win win, win win, win win, win win, win
Win win, win win, win win, win win, win
Win win, win win, win win, win win, win
Turn the deuce to a 4 to a 9, make history
Half to a whole over night this is victory
Win win, win win, win win, win win, win
Win win, win win, win win, win win, win
Win win, win win, win win, win win, win
Hundred brawlers in a club at one time, ain't shit to me
So tonight everything's on me, this is victory

Still the trapper of the year, where the fuck my trophy at
Ever was a real nigga title guess who's holding that
Popping rosay in the club guess who told 'em that
Standing on the stage making rain guess who showin' that
I aint never took nobody to da the spot, half of million there
Before I ever even seen the mike was a millionaire
Seen Jizzle stunting on gangland Diamonds in his chain,
If you look a little closer, Diamonds spell his name
With the hundreds with the hundreds yeah that's right straighten up the mail
Got enough shit in my head to send me straight to jail
Welcome to a day in the light, they just talking drugs
Co sign half these niggas, I'm the fucking plug

Win win, win win, win win, win win, win
Win win, win win, win win, win win, win
Win win, win win, win win, win win, win
Turn the deuce to a 4 to a 9, make history
Half to a whole over night this is victory
Win win, win win, win win, win win, win
Win win, win win, win win, win win, win
Win win, win win, win win, win win, win
Hundred brawlers in a club at one time, ain't shit to me
So tonight everything's on me, this is victory.
