I feel like I'm by myself
I'm here I'm so alone


Everytime I turn around, I see your face boy
I wish I was by myself (myself)
Said I wish I was by myself
I don't need you no, no more...

Everytime I turn around, I see your face boy
I wish I was by myself (myself)
Said I wish I was by myself
No pain, no more, no more...

All my tears & all my cryin'
Nothin' is change cause you still lyin'
What you're sellin' I'm not buyin'
Don't you stop me, I'm ready to go...

I don't need your circumstances 
I'll just leave it, take my chances
Tired of playin' in fake romances
Don't you stop me, I'm ready to go...


You said that you'll be, forever truly 
How you lied so clearly
You can start over, 
but you wont be near me


Everytime I turn around, I see your face boy
I wish I was by myself (myself)
Said I wish I was by myself
I don't need you no, no more...

Everytime I turn around, I see your face boy
I wish I was by myself (myself)
Said I wish I was by myself
No pain, no more, no more...


Now put yourself in my position
I'm a late-night trickin'
While you home cookin' 
I went my dog's right n' lookin'
Oh we in the strip club
Throwin' up dozens 
When you ask me for some cash
I'm lookin' at you funny
I aint got no money
Baby I'm broken
I can do you how I wanna
Cause I pay your card though
Remember I've given you the check
I'm the nigga
I got friends so whateva' 
I understand that your betta


You said that you'll be, forever truly 
How you lied so clearly
You can start over, 
but you wont be near me


Everytime I turn around, I see your face boy
I wish I was by myself (myself)
Said I wish I was by myself
I don't need you no, no more...

Everytime I turn around, I see your face boy
I wish I was by myself (myself)
Said I wish I was by myself
No pain, no more, no more...


You said that you'll be, forever truly 
How you lied so clearly
You can start over, 
but you wont be near me

You said that you'll be, forever truly 
How you lied so clearly
You can start over, 
but you wont be near me


Everytime I turn around, I see your face boy
I wish I was by myself (myself)
Said I wish I was by myself
I don't need you no, no more...

Everytime I turn around, I see your face boy
I wish I was by myself (myself)
Said I wish I was by myself
No pain, no more, no more...
