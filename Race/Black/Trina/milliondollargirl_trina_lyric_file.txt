Out the cockpit of my layer
That's dirty money (Uh uh)
You starving hungry (That's right..)
I got a million in singles
Take it all of, shake it for me
No renting
My millions hydro-planed
And I'm done with sandro-playin'
In my lambo ice coat painted
I'm richer than all the riches in the world
You ain't no could be and I ain't tryna buy you

Million dollar swell

Strong and built like horses
Glass of Chardonnay
