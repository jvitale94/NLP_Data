Its the codes of the streets
The words we live by & die by
U noe the way we survive this life out here
Its no other way
The only way
Is to be loyal till the end

Loyalty
The code of the street 
The word I live by & die by aint nuthin sweet 
Rap star goes hollywood from the street
& the only word that I noe is loyalty
See I noe the difference separate the bullshit from the buissness
Feel me? listen.
I am past driven
Nuthin was given
I cant remember of days I had livin
Trust nobody keep ur enemies close
Where ur friends when you need them? when you need them the most?
Most times that you need them most of them are ghost
Even doe they unloyal still give them a toast
Trust nobody keep ur enemies close
Who noe ur dark secrets what you doin the most?
U noe that hot shit ?? bout 2 promote like rappers talking bout guns & dont even tote
Yea


L.O.Y.A.L.T.Y
Loyalty 
Loyal till the day I die
Thats the code of the streets
Thats the way I ride & I'ma ride like that 

Some friends qot the best of me 
Shitted on me on the way
But I wonder was it all for they destani?
Now theres a diffrence see? you aint gotta rob em it dont take nuthin
U can use ur own energy
See I depend on me
Bless the child with its own 
Grab my own glass say bless & you hold it into me
See aint no killin me
I noe you feelin me
I blast the speakers with the truth
Hear the chemistry

Trust nobody keep ur enemies close
Where ur friends when you need them? when you need them da most?
Most times that you need them most of them are qhost
Even doe they unloyal still give them a toast
Trust nobody keep ur enemies close
Who noe ur dark secrets? what you doin the most?
U noe that hot shit ?? bout 2 promote like rappers talking bout guns & dont even tote

He say, She say, Tell somebody 
Can you keep a secret? dont tell nobody
Its ur loyalty, pill, will you swich for money?
When ur shit hit the fame will you think its funny?

Trust nobody keep ur enemies close
Where ur friends when you need them
When you need them the most?
Most times that you need them most of them are ghost
Even doe they unloyal still give them a toast
Trust nobody keep ur enemies close
Who noe ur dark secrets what you doin the most?
U noe that hot shit ?? bout 2 promote like rappers talking bout guns & dont even tote
