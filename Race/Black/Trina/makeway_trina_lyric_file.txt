

I'm just tryna make sure
That you hear me out there

Now when you see the queen coming
And the horn start blowing
(hey trina)
Everybody start running
People in the streets coming

(it's been a while baby)
But they still gotta bow down
To tha queen ha-ha yea

Now when you see the queen coming
And all the horns start blowing
Everybody start running
People in the streets coming

Make way, make way, make way
Make way, make way, make way
Make way whoaaaa

See the fireworks blowing
And the roof start smoking
And you know it ain't a game
With the lines this woman make way

Make way, make way, make way
Make way, make way, make way, way

Every-time I turn the t.v. on
All I see is trina
Everybody so quick to judge me
Look how you point the finger

Saying he's to good for me
When you don't even know me
You to lonely, you need
To worry bout yours only

Like a rag you throw me
Some pretend they don't know me
Bet you know you owe me
Show me homie

Tryna steal my pride
They make me go harder
Do I worry, I don't bother
I'ma finish what I started

Working more than 9 to 5
Keeping it slip an slide dream alive
Look at some of these chicks that try (try)
Half of them lost their flame they die (die)

While I been walking on fire
I'm earning to go higher
Never kick out the game
I shall retired, now put that on the wirer

I crap the game like pliers
I'm doing the whole dash
Staring like I'm wearing tires
Cant, to fine to stop (cant, to fine stop)

I'ma diva studio to states
My people gotta make way
For queen before I clear the streets

Now if you see the queen coming
All the horns are blowing
And everybody start running
People in the streets coming

Make way, make way, make way
Make way, make way, make way
Make way whoaaaa

See the fireworks blowing
And the roof start smoking
And you know it ain't a game
With the lines this woman make way

Make way, make way, make way
Make way, make way, make way,way

What makes you think this life
More easier for me
If you can only see
If ain't all that is crack up to be

More money, more problems
When you living like this
If you ain't making hits
Than you ain't about shit

Fans go to talking
Neighbors go to shopping
Am I'm really human
Is when I go to talking

Huffin an the puffin
Tears start fallin
Than the whole turns cold
That's when you wanna pick your coffin

But I ain't giving up
I ain't never be a quiter
I go hard on everything
I'm a natural born winner

When natural born sinner
But I'm praying for forgiveness
Some-times I pinch my-self
Than I realize I live this

Some say relentless
I say forgiveness
That's when I pinch my-self
And than I realize I live this

Some say relentless
I say forgiveness
That's when I pinch my-self
And than I realize I live this

Now when you see the queen coming
And all the horns start blowing
Everybody start running
People in the streets coming

Make way, make way, make way
Make way, make way, make way
Make way, whoaaaaaaa

See the fireworks blowing
And the roof start smoking
And you know it ain't a game
With the lines this woman make way

Make way, make way, make way
Make way, make way, make way,way
