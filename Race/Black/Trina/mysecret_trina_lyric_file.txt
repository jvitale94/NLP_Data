Thats the way we shuld keep it
Yea you qotta a man
But he dont really qotta noe
Yea I qot a qirl she dont really qotta noe
We can keep it private 
& keeep it on the low

Ur my lil secret thats how we shuld keep it
I wont tell my friends
Dont nobody qotta noe
Wateva that you need boy you can come to me boy
See im independent & I make my own douqh
We can do wateva. I can do it betta
We can take a private fliqht & get away & go
U can call me baby I can be ur lady
Soon as you qet ready wont you let ur qirl noe
Cuz baby if you dont tell I wont either
Take this trip wit a rockstar diva
U dnt need her & I dnt need him neither
I promise if you do it you'll be wishen you culd leave her


Ur my lil secret 
Thats the way we shuld keep it
Yea you qotta a man
But he dont really qotta noe
Yea I qot a qirl she dont really qotta noe
We can keep it private 
& keeep it on the low

I qot trust in the world wen im thinkin of you
Yea I qot a man but I think bout you
He dnt noe how to qet it & do the things you do
I cant put it in no words
We both noe its wrong I think thts y we do it
We cant stay long so we get rite 2 it
We do pillow talk & qet rite back to it
The bed be so wet I just love the way you do it
Phh-wee-babyy wen you touch my body I qo crazy
I be bout to lose my mind on the daily
Rimanisin on the love you qave me


Ur my lil secret 
Thats the way we shuld keep it
Yea you qotta a man
But he dont really qotta noe
Yea I qot a qirl she dont really qotta noe
We can keep it private 
& keeep it on the low


Cuz ur my secret I wont tell nobody
How I qive you my love kisses & hugs
If nobody noe they cant break us up
