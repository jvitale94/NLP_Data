Throwing up your gang signs but you don't really know whats up (know whats up)

Now you can rap about it, sing about it, write about it, think about it, act it out on tv,
But you ain't on the big screen.
Dressed the role re-an act the video.
But until shit unfolds yo...ohhh ohh. 

Are you sayin you's a thug? ballin at the club?
What bout ya kids? ya baby mama holdin the drugs?
You livin in the projects, in and outta jail, trynna keep up with the joneses but you cant post bail?
Well okay is that your testimony?
Screamin ride or die take a bullet for your hommie,
Hommie you need to get your life straight before your permanent residence is livin in a state prison.
Now you found out your baby mama is livin wit your home boy that's why she ain't come to visit.
Blocks on the phone you cant call collect.
Ain't it funny how fast people tend to forget.
Its a whole new ball game.
Who's thinking bout you? you ain't get one letter from you old ball and crew,
They livin there life with out you,
And ask them for some commissary, bet they'll lie and say they send it...   

Now you can rap about it, sing about it, write about it, think about it, act it out on tv,
But you aint on the big screen.
Dressed the role re-an act the video.
But until shit unfolds yo...ohhh ohh. 

Had dreams of bein sucessful,
Graduated on time found a girl that you loved told everybody shes a dime,
In do time she starts to get you un-focused all the games that she play magic tricks hocus pocus.
In and out ya life you was out there doin drugs no career on ya mind cuz you dangerously in love try a lil weed to help release the stress when that ain't good enough what you gun try next?
8 balls up the nose, no hes out there smokin crack you homeless, you ruined your life just like that. just cause of that just one small mistake you re-ranged your life witch determines your fate.
Witch one you gunna choose pushin rocks on the block just to get a pair of shoes.
A real thug gots stocks bounds and homes 4 5 cars, legit employment, like me I spit bars.

Now you can rap about it, sing about it, write about it, think about it, act it out on tv,

You said you grew up in the suburbs still claming the hood thinkin you bad,
Now you and your home boys up to no good.
You stay strapped but that don't make you hard.
Smoking that sticky icky... talkin shit but your still just playin the part 

Now your screaming thug life, you don't wanna live the life of a thug (of a thug)
Throwing up your gang signs but you don't really know whats up (know whats up)

You think its just a game, something to entertain, tryin to make a name.
But you don't know a thanggggg...

A thug life on these streets ain't as easy as it seems.
