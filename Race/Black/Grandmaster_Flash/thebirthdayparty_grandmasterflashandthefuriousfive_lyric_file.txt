Don't get excited but it's gonna be
The best birthday party in history
We're gonna celebrate the gift of birth
The living jewel of planet Earth
So come on, come all to the birthday ball
Every day this spring, summer, winter and fall
From dusk 'till dawn, from dawn 'till dusk
If the crowd don't get you, the music must
Cause it's jam packed from back to back
You're in, you're out, cause you like it like that
Let's rock, let's rock and rock
Don't stop
Pat your foot and let your fingers pop
I wanna hear you loud and clear

Everybody say, "One" (One), Flash, one time
Say, "Two" (Two), Flash, two times
Say, "Three" (Three), Flash, three times
Say, "Four" (Four), Flash, five times

All the guys better find a girl
Cause if you stay apart
We're gonna move the groove until we prove
That we're gonna shake you, break your heart

All the girls better find a guy
All the guys better find a girl
Cause we're gonna hip and hop til we hit the top
Cause we gonna rock and shock the whole world

And I'm Mr. Ness, gon' make you shout the best
Rahiem gon' make you scream scream scream

Cowboy gonna make you jump for joy
And Flash gonna cut the cut so fast

But those of you who remember the line
Help me finish the rhyme -- c'mon y'all
We gonna try something new
What you gonna do?

If you want to scream to the break of dawn
At the count of three, scream loud and long

One, two, three -- hit it, hit it

Cause we gonna rock and shock the whole world

All the guys better find a girl
Cause if you stay apart
We're gonna move the groove until we prove
That we're gonna shake you, break your heart
