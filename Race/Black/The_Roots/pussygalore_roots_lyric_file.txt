Girl it's you that I adore
Step on stage and scream for more
All I see, pussy galore
Snap my fingers make you mine
If not I'll snap a second time
After that I guarantee
You will be stanfing next to me

My old him once said, "it's more power than cocaine
Freaks dancing in a line like Soul Train"
To give your product that extra push
Niggas lookin for the time of their life, coppin' a rush
Yo I know sis, Dog, her name Lorraine
See that thick brick house with the chocolate frame
I went to school with her, 12th grade I used to fool with her
She put me on with her squad, I got cool with her
She use to say she wanna be a doctor
and couldn't nothing stop her
from getting up that cash
For tuition even if she had to shake that ass
Fucked up; her money ain't accumulate that fast
Lorraine know it's real, ans sex control America
Turn the T.V. on, it's in the open of the regular(right?)
What the freaks in the video for?
Fuck a song, give me a thong and pussy galore

You see, life's about marketing pussy galore
Every time I turn around it's more pussy galore
Nations goin to war for the pussy galore
Either the cash, the raw or the pussy galore
Yo, gang wars? more Pussy galore
From the screen to the record store pussy galore
Every time I turn around it's more pussy galore
Either the cash, the raw or the pussy galore

Yo, desire and lust can make a man kill
Or jump off the bridge cuffed to a muthafuckin' anvil
So it's promoted like that's all ya'll know
Keep a nigga under the spell, you under control
But yo I seen it make people slit they wrists
Weakness, pussy make a spot sing secrets 
But what for, cause sex is the law, law, law
And done been many an empire to rise and fall
From the squares to the players to the pimps and whores,
To big checks that never would have been endorsed
You know, I sit back and just peep things
9 out of 10 it's the same song, only the beat change
So don't be looking at Tariq strange 
When I conduct a little litmus test up in your heat range 
That's when you see me on stage with six
Wicked ass chicks
Fittin' to get crunk with this

You see, life's about marketing and pussy galore
Every time I turn around i smell pussy galore
Corporations goin' to war for the pussy galore
Either the cash, the raw or the pussy galore
Yo, gang wars more ussy galore
From the streets to the record store, pussy galore
Every time I turn around it's more pussy galore
Every time I turn around it's more pussy galore

Yo, fresh cut, with the thick black velour
With the black Luke sneaks
Headin' out for tour
Looking out the limo window up at the billboards
200 miles, She was the only thing I saw
Promoting everything from the liquor, to the nicotine
Cell phones, antihistamine, chicken wing
You gotta show a little skin to get them listening 
For real yo, the world is a sex machine
Full of pretty freaks in designer jeans
That go to extremes to conjure all kinds of schemes
Half the time it ain't even responsibly
Trying to take me someplace I ain't tryna be
GHETTO sin city where the P is free
You catch a bid far worser than a 1 to 3
All up in the after hours on the 2nd floor
For that good thang that keep em comin back for more

It's about market and the pussy galore
Every time I turn around I smell pussy galore
Nations goin to war for the pussy galore
Even the cash, the raw or the pussy galore
Dig it, gang wars, more pussy galore
From the street to the record store, pussy galore
Even the cash, the raw or the pussy galore
More pussy galore, more pussy galore
