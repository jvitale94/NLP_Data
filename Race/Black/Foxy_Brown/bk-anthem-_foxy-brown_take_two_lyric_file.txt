VERSE 1
I grew up in the thoroughest borough
Where big had everybody rocking DK
Gav was the first dude with the CLK
And bricks was getting shipped outta east LA
It’s brooklyn where niggas lives is tooken
Rich cats got knocked and they wives was tooken
Fort greene and hemlock
The 5th been cocked
We cried when they killed lenox pop the glock
A yo did y’all hear what the fuck I just said
BK the home of biggie and jay
Where niggas got will smith chips
Get jiggy all day
Bitches that boost in the city all day
Heckle the cops crack spots federal watch
I grew up here
Sip mo threw up here
Yo the feds snatched two up here in BK
031’s and boost the cells in CK
gorillas got rich from stairwells in PA

VERSE 2
Brooklyn
The livest borough
You come here fronting you might die in this borough
The east I’m feeling bed-stuy in this borough
It’s full of projects, the livest borough
Don’t try to figure out which side is thorough
From CI to St. Marks it’s carrying cons
Niggas rock coogi and dolce gaban
Some women make a living just carrying bombs
We pop corks a little bit, we floss a little bit
In the club buying out kris, pour us a little bit
I told y’all that my borough is thorough
I know niggas that’ll clap you up and bury the metal
Same day we still in the hood
So ghetto, Brooklon, holla back get your crook on
Live from the 718 we raise the 8
Everytime papi raise the price of that weight

VERSE 3
It’s BK nigga get your vest ate up
Over them chips you could get SK’d up
Find you in back of the building sprayed up
All for the love of this paper we misled
By 21 some ‘ll be dead
By 22 the rest of these dudes ‘ll be in the feds
We got change but we still fucked up
Niggas is outta jail but they still locked up
Them feds taking flicks so we pulling the drops up
BK open up get popped up
You know it’s the borough where cats drive with the box in they trucks
Tre pound glocked wrist be locked up
Yelling that get down, lay down when we pop up
Blocks so hot we drive the drops with the tops up
Windows tinted you can’t see who’s in it
It’s brown nigga I represent it
Brooklyn
