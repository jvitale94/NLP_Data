My heart is filled with so much love
And I need someone I can call my own
To fall in love, is what everyone's dreaming of
I hold this feeling oh, so strong

Life is too short to live alone
Without someone to call my own
I will care for you, you will care for me
Our love will live forever

Shower me with your love
Shower me with the love I long for
Shower me with your love
Shower me with the love I've waited for

I close my eyes and pray all my wishes come true
Every night I go to sleep
Until you're mine, I'll wait for you endlessly
Can't you see I need you

Fairy tales they, they do come true
If you believe, it could happen to you
Like the stars that shine way up in the sky
Our love will live forever

Shower me with your love
Shower me with the love I long for
Shower me with your love
Shower me with the love I've waited for

My heart is filled with so much love
And I need someone I can call my own
To fall in love, is what everyone's dreaming of
I hold this feeling oh, so strong

Life is too short to live alone
Without someone to call my own
I will care for you, you will care for me
Our love will live forever

Shower me with your love
Shower me with the love I long for
Shower me with your love
Shower me with the love I long for

Shower me with your love
Shower me with the love I
