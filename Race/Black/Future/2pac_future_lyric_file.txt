My little brother he ain't scared he got two Glocks
Push a blunt in my dreads I'm with 2pacs
Hes my young nigga he'll shoot you for a two pack
A bandana 'round my head like I'm 2pac
My little cousins they got feds around with two choppers
And when you imaginate they tryna' sell you two flocks
Got a bandana 'round my head like I'm 2pac

Got a bandana 'round my head screaming thug life
I get faded out the vans on a money day
Got a bandana round my head like a soilder
Get that chopper on a nigga like Magnoli
Push a blunt in my dreads I'm with two pacs
For my brother 16 birthday momma bought a new Glock
These niggas taking out they head for a new watch
My young nigga he ain't scared he oughta new baller
How to fuck around and catch that hollow om some looters huh
Bitch ain't never speed no iglo I swear two chopper
Got a bandana 'round my head like I'm birdman
I love my dope, when my grandma had a servent



These hood bitches loving a nigga like alpo
My lil cousin got that yapper automatic bro
Got designer on my collar like I'm banjo
I got all these problems with polo dojo
These niggas killing everyobodys bitches fuck that dirty pussy
These niggas ain't used to pimping they gon' pay for pussy
Got that bandana round my head like a rebel boy
All this money in my system I can see the devil
Ain't playing with these broke niggas, skip to the other round
Caught a felony, can feel the kilos
On me now feel me now feel me
They have lasers on me now they wanna kill me
Got banna clips on banna clips on bannana clips
