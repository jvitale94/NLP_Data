And I had my pistol in my pocket
Can't trust none of these bitches, gotta be cautious
Can't trust none of these bitches, gotta be cautious
I bought all the sodas at the gas station
I just put a famous bitch on rotation
I just put that famous bitch on rotation
I just pull a shawty out on probation

Paranoia pulling up garage one in the head
I'm a hydroponic nigga full of bars and that red
I'mma camouflage in, I fell in love with this brick
I don't ordinary no type of nigga I don't beat
I thought I keep that tool on me everywhere
Spent a couple mill on my bitch last year
I just put a new whip on the E-way
Then I ran my bands back up like a relay
Certified junkie
I just pop the tag on the bands, it was Monday
I just keep that bag on me now at least 100
I've been on them Xans and that molly, I ain't frontin'

And I had my pistol in my pocket
Can't trust none of these bitches, gotta be cautious

Bro, I can't tell you 'bout no capers
I just took the middle man off
I go Corleone by the cheque
I was getting dome with a tick
Bitch, you ain't gon' get no extra parts putting on faggot mood
I just called my contractor, told him "build another pool"
One sitting in the back, one by the living room
I keep all my jury at the bank now
Alexander McQueen's therapeutic
Bitch, I'm getting the same money as Cam Newton
Ask me how it feel to be a millionare

I had to spill at shawty with my jeans on
