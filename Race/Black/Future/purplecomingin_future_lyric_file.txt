I'm good on that yola, yola, I'm good with that yola, yola
I'm good with that red and yellow, nigga
I'm good with that red and yellow, nigga
Purple be coming in
We got that purp coming in, we got that purp coming in
The purple be coming in, purple, purple, purp, purp


I'm good with that yola, yola, nigga
I'm good with that yellow and red, nigga
I'm good with that yellow and red, nigga
I'm good with that yellow and red, nigga
That purple be coming in, that purple be coming in
That purple be coming in, that purple be coming in

That purple be coming in
I poured up a dirty Sprite again
I pop on these Percs and Vicodins
They check on that check like a Yeezy
Came from straight out them trenches, they greasy
Fuck a bitch on that shit, I don't need her
Fell in love with that drank and I need it
I sip out my cup and I need it
I grew up in the red and I seized it
Sip the four of that 'tuss out in Cleveland
They can't blame me for takin' these doses
Pour that raw out, the pint in the fanta
Tryna dodge all these scandalous heathens
They never gone doubt me, now they believe me
They try to forget about me now I'm kinging
The greatest story ever told
These pretty hoes gettin' exposed
Got my styrofoam in my hand
Fuck all these bands up





Walk into Barney's I'm drinkin' on yolo
Valet the photo, a hundred at the door
I speak the lingo, they go by the limo
Fuck you lil nigga, I'mma fill up arenas
Washin' the money at the cleaners, it's dirty
You drink out my cup and it's dirty, I come from the dirty
You drink out this cup and it's dirty
I got codeine in my bladder
I get it in like a real one
You whip in a Benz and they feel you
It's too much finnessin' you feel me?
I went at that money, no supervision
They love me today, they gone really feel me
I see how they act when they playin' dirty
Forgivin' me, never forgivin' me
I know that paper gone be there, it stack it
A monster, a beast uncorrupted, a savage
And 20's, Sting gotta have it
That baby wants a Saleen, she can have it
Pay three for that purple, if you want it, you get it
Two dollars a drink, on that purp you can get it
Fuck on me, suck on me, baby lets pour up
Fuck on me, suck on me, baby lets pour up
