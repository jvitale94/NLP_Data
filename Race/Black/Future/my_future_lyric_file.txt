

Super future
Yea
Ay we’ll never be global nigga


My wrist on the 40’s
Fresh as Michael jordans
My car ain't even dropped yet
Already done ordered it
Came across a fortune
Now I got endorsements
You wanna see a movie
You can press record it
My place is enormous
And my girl is gorgeous
Hit it wit the fork yeah?
Pull up in a porshe
My chain is a stop light
And I'm sittin on forges
Trickin ain't a habit
If you can afford it


My shoe game is 1000
What the fuck you doin
Hit it with the sb
Ain't no way you losin
Codeine in my Styrofoam
Leanin like a motorcycle
Order me a Bentley
And its comin wit the
Dolce and gabana
Her man in dior
I'm dressed so exclusive
This not in your stores
Fresh as Michael Jordan
I think I can fly now
Drankin me some dirty
Have you checked my background
Audimar for 
Presidential rolley
I might wear that 
And its fully loaded
My bank roll a building
Up there wit the millions
I'm not your average star
I'm no registered villain

My vvs my necklace
Glistenin like some cyrstals
I got on my jewelry
Think I ain't got that pistol
Pocket full of franklins
Stuffed in my Versace’s
Lean inside my cup
And I put ice inside my watches
Ordered up that new coupe
I just left the dealer
Ballin like I super hoop
Michael Jordan my nigga
Espn and showtime
Wanna see my highlights
Future is a rock star
And I live that high life
Bottles in my section
Didn’t u seen them sparkles
Shawty in deception
Ain't that girl a model
Splurging is a habit
Money not a problem
Yes I am a rich nigga
Came straight from the bottom
