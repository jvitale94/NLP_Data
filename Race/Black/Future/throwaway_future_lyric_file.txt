We are illegal we don't play with you it's goin' be okay
I want no relations, I just want your facial 
Pour some alcohol and drank it baby, gone and taste it 
I want no relations, I just want your facial
Girl you know you like a pistol, you a throw away


We gon' drank girl we gon' drink Likes it's cinco de mayo
I won't ever tell you anything your heart desires
It's gon' be okay okay girl it's gon' be okay
I don't want no confrontation it too complicated
Throw my v's up bet it you will hide a thottie
I'm a fuck you in Atlanta like we on an island
I can't lose my concentration girl I can't go on no dates
If we have a conversation gotta fuck today
I ain't disrespect for never, I ain't disrespecting
Got a black girl and a white one call em salt and pepper
I call one of em my beamer and one my compressor (skrr)
I tote albums call em back now I'm back from outta Texas




Deep down, I believe you know you're a monster too
Gone fuck that nigga get it over with 
Yea yea... Future Hendrix

I know your true feelings ain't... the couldn't be here you hear me?
They gotta be somewhere else


But I ain't worried 'bout no fucking I ain't worried 'bout no fucking
Does sexing on the late night mean that much to ya
My love don't mean that much to ya
Fucking these hoes mean too damn much to you
I just hope up when you fuck a nigga when you finished, he can say that he love ya
Now do you feel better bout yourself? do you feel better bout yourself?
Do you feel better when I love ya, mark my words I'm a ball with without you
I came home last night to a m√©nage
Got my dick sucked I was thinking about you
I was fucking on a slut and I was thinking about you
When you're fucking another nigga hope you're thinking about me
When you laying with that nigga are you thinking about me
Cause I'm thinking about you
Gone fuck that nigga get it over with
Gone fuck that nigga get it over with


I want you to fuck him in paradise
Cause I wanna be your air tonight
If loving me in public ain't safe
You can take my love and hide it, don't give up on me today
Hold on to me like a true love
I told you it wasn't true love, I ended up with temptations
You going out the country, you posting up on IG
I'm Layed up with my side piece
I wana taste, while you was right there laying right beside me
Now tell me you don't want me
Tell me that your pussy ain't mines no more
Tell me your moving on, you don't love me no more
Monster
