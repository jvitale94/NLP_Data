Oh, I just called to see how you been doin' late
I didn't call to start a new relation, no
It's been a long time coming, babe

You ran across my mind, and I ain't trippin'
 canary yellow birds are drippin' off me
I was young when I fucked with you,
You wouldn't understand the person that I grown into
I put in overtime inside this vocal booth
It's amazing how crazy in love you wit' the kid
I used to hold you by your waist and you'd look up to the kid,
You was out cryin', why you ridin' on the kid,
We should've won an award off the movies that we did.
We both moved on, I bet you still reminiscing.
I hurt you so bad, I just need for you to listen,
We was friends before all of this,
I wanna see you happy girl no matter who you're with,
On some real shit...

Ey, it's been a long time coming, babe
Oh, I just called to see how you been doin' late
I didn't call to start a new relation, no
It's been a long time coming, babe

Over the weekend at the Vegas, crossed my memory
I was taking out the limo thinking
How much you was there for me, I got you forever, wherever
That's just the man in me, I look at you like family
Wanna see how you been doin'
I turned you to a fucking beast
Remember how we ran the streets and fucked until we'd go to sleep,
I know you ain't forgot that, I doubt that
Even though that nigga housed that, you still left yo heart back
I'ma wait for you to call back, I'ma fall back
I'm over there, yeah
Ay, let me reflect for a second
Nuttin' serious tho'
I'm happy than I ever been before
You need some help, don't hesitate to hit me up, you know
I ain't on that lil' boy shit, girl I'm just lettin' ya know.

Ey, it's been a long time coming, babe
Oh, I just called to see how you been doin' late
I didn't call to start a new relation, no
It's been a long time coming, babe

Ey, it's been a long time coming, babe
Oh, I just called to see how you been doin' late
I didn't call to start a new relation, no
It's been a long time coming, babe
