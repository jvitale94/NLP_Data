A lot of niggas tryna catch up with that
But they don't seen what I done seen up in these streets
Crack addicts and dope house, how many you want
We grew up in the scrubs,
But now we at the dealership with all our friends,
Holler that, how many you want
You electrical and exceptional and inside of you
Is an angel named St. Michael,
He say he's in there to protect you and never lie to you
It's so hard to be faithful, but you sing to me,
You hold me down, I'm a try for you


Come here, you swearing I be yours 
You drink and I be yours 
Gal, you in'hear what I'm sayn
You rockin', I be yours 
Do that, everything that I need and I'll be yours
And you know that I will: one word, and I'll be yours 
And you know that I feel, that's my word


Either your friend got my back
She just mem' it, but she feel it
And she goes to eat somebody's time and shit
We gon' kill it
Either mine on your wrist, that just somethin' for today
Driving Rolls for the week, Subaru for the skeet
Got that condo for the month
You get massages for an hour
Red lipstick on my body print
I can see the way you seducing, I promise


Come here, you swearing I be yours 
You drink and I be yours 
Gal, you in'hear what I'm sayn
You rockin', I be yours 
Do that, everything that I need and I'll be yours
And you know that I will: one word, and I'll be yours 
And you know that I feel, that's my word
