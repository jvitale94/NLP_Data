My momma said fuck it niggah hit the streets and live.
Got some crack in the corner and I did what I did.
The neighbors they don't like me I got jays at the door
Told my grandma I don't needa bed I'm sleeping on the floor
Got my tool and my blow then my two main hoes
Me and all my woahs stick together like the Zoes
Sak pase who got the yay for the lows
And I keep birds with me like I'm straight out hollygrove


My fingers, they itchin they itchin for dat paper
I'm riding round the city and I got that calculator
Ima mothafukin monsta wen it come to getting that paper (aye)

Ima dog, and I eat that dog food
Ima G, I put red on all my shoes
Come and see my la familia got peru
And I plead not guilty until proved
Got birds than the zoo
Got chickens in the coup
Got shottas that'll shoot
And I stay on dj screw
Wen u drop it it coming back like dj clue
I make a profit I can go and by school
Ima A1 nigga can't lose
Free band gang put u on the news
Then hit Blue Flames shoot pool
Put 20 my tru's then 20,000 fool
I put a plate together like paid man in dues
I'm (w)rapping dope to yew


My fingers, they itchin they itchin for dat paper
I'm riding round the city and I got that calculator
Ima mothafuqin monsta wen it come to getting that paper (aye)
