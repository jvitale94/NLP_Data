I'm making it hard for these little rap chicks to come out
I'm copping whips, you in the street with your thumb out
You wanna battle but when it's time to spit, you dumb out
Singles, I've touched, been going platinum since the first one out

I put on seven niggas just to carry me on
Amilliyon say the hook, let 'em carry the song
I be the only bitch on the mic making it hot
With the smoke in the drop in the vacant lot

Since this bitch been in this game, I been taking spots
And if you hating me, shit, you must be hating the Roc
Take it there, yeah, I break it down like this
Ain't a bitch live who can make it sound like this

Don't make Amilliyon have to pull rank
Lyrics never on E, I keep a full tank
Any nigga that I fuck wit, got my name in the bank
Yeah, you heard me, he got at least my name in the bank

Everything I spit be raw
I be like 10 pounds of coke and be quick to draw
And it's pure fuck, Miami, it be Ecuador
For my peeps fuck a foot, I got they leg in the door

Everything I spit be raw
I be like 10 pounds of coke and be quick to draw
And it's pure fuck, Miami, it be Ecuador
For my peeps fuck a foot, I got they leg in the door

Yo, let's take it to the whips, bitch, five or six
We could take it to the block, flip dimes to bricks
Take it to the mic, see who spit the livest shit
Who wanna take it to the streets to the nines and clips?

I'm the bitch that won't skate when daddy empty the safe
Lie on the stand if Jake hem 'em up with a case
Far as this rap shit, fuck fame or shine or rhyme
I don't care who joint drop the same time as mine

Chicks redo albums once they heard my buzz
Motherfuckers know I'm a track murderer
So you could pop shit, bitch, run your mouth
I know niggas that'll get you right in front of your house

For free and that's just on the strength of me
If you could touch Amil, then you could mention me
You think Jay wrote this, that's complimenting me
I'm the best 'til somebody prove me differently

Everything I spit be raw
I be like 10 pounds of coke and be quick to draw
And it's pure fuck, Miami, it be Ecuador
For my peeps fuck a foot, I got they leg in the door

Everything I spit be raw
I be like 10 pounds of coke and be quick to draw
And it's pure fuck, Miami, it be Ecuador
For my peeps fuck a foot, I got they leg in the door

You got beef, let's put it all on the table
You want the hottest clique on the street, you know the label
You want the hottest bitch ever known, I willing and able
Could y'all broads be story tale like a Eastside fable?

You want me to spit, bitch, make it payable
If you lucky, if you'll be hearing back within a day or two
That's just coming from a chick who done paid her dues
Know I'm the hottest chick from kicks to the gator shoes

Ayo, respect this shield of David piece on the necklace
Now who wanna take it to some next shit?
Hey, yo, I crush all bitches, eat up most niggas
Teach these rap broads, train gold diggas

You know I know niggas and you know I hold figures
We speak but that don't mean my niggas is yo' niggas
We up in your spot, strapped with the hoods on
I am  Major Coins and any bitch I put on, nigga

Everything I spit be raw
I be like 10 pounds of coke and be quick to draw
And it's pure fuck, Miami, it be Ecuador
For my peeps fuck a foot, I got they leg in the door

Everything I spit be raw
I be like 10 pounds of coke and be quick to draw
And it's pure fuck, Miami, it be Ecuador
For my peeps fuck a foot, I got they leg in the door
