I blow a hundred million, make another hundred mill bitch
I’m on it, I-I I’m on it
I hustle hard, oh my God
Look at me I’m so rich
I’m on it, I-I I’m on it
My swag on a hundred, Yeah that fly shit I want it quick
I’m on it, I-I I’m on it
I’m always on point man I make niggas so sick


I’m chin chillin, crystal spillin’
Hip hop’s villain cause I’m makin’ a killin’
Niggas wan’ try me, I’m strapped with the lammy
If Jay’s illuminati, What am I? Am I Bugatti?
Ladi dodi, we like to party
Big 4 in the morning, go outside and catch a body
I ball full time nigga this is not a hobby
If you don’t know about me, better ask somebody
Yeah, I’m grimey, my wrist so shiny
My Audemar I blew a mill, I’m back to making money
My swag make her want me
Why else would she be on me
I bet she hardly want me? I think she want to blow
Lick me like a lolly, li-lick me like a lolly
Her ass ain't all that but her tits like dolly’s
Give me that punani, g-g-give me that punani
Now this is motivation make me want more money




I got it, black card in my wallet
Find me on locations with model bitches?
Fly shit I rock it, Tom Ford, exotic
Bitches on my dick now that I moved up out the projects
One for the money, two for the show
I’m ghetto like a muthafucker, what you didn’t know?
Took threes for my niggas gettin’ 8 hundred an O
Kush burn slow, I b-burn dough and sip Merlot like I’m on furlow
Fr-fresh up out the pen, I’m back at it again
Thumpin’ like the system in my new big body benz
Look I’m a Fat Joe, my neck glow
The lights hit the ice, its a special effects show
TInkle twinkle little star
No-one here knows who you are
Me I’m so big, notorious you dig
The paper’s no problem when ya fucking with tha kid
