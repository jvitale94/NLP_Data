


I came in the world crying and fussing
Nigga, we ain't have nothing
Every ghetto I know the same
We try to make a little change
Preacher man come around talking
I don't wanna hear it, keep walking
I'm a put the powder in the pot
Whip it till I'm pulling off a lot
Imagine when I pull it off the lot
New shit come without a top
Once I'm on I ain't never gon stop
Bitch, I'm on, I ain't never gon stop


I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man


Aye, came in the game getting money
Flipping chickens, whip it, getting money
Niggas get to playing with the money
Clique bang for the money
Shit changed over money
They love to see a nigga on the bottom
Catch it coming, gotta keep it on the low
A nigga plug bless a nigga with a whole
Wanna break the bitch down into 36 O's
Looky here, bitch, I'm A-okay
Shorty wanna fuck with me
Stripping, yeah, the jiggy, nigga
Lady, she gon hit my line
We ain't gon waste no time
She sucking and we fucking like she need me
While she make a bankroll easy
All the light in the room from the T.V
We getting it on then I'm gone
It's the type of shit that a nigga be on


Too much on my mind right now
I'm on the grind right now
Looking for me, sucker, then I need to be found right now
I got my nine right now
Bitch, I'll blow your mind right now
I ain't fucking around right now
Better get in line right now
Or fuck around and die right now
Hope you understand that


Bitch, I'm the man, ho, I'm the man, you know I'm the man
Bitch, I'm the man, ho, I'm the man, you know I'm the man
Bitch, I'm the man, ho, I'm the man, you know I'm the man
Bitch, I'm the man, ho, I'm the man, you know I'm the man


Came in the game getting money
I fuck with all the bitches getting money
But you love playing games with all the corny shit
Messing with a nigga, I only bought it cause I want it
You love to see a nigga on the bottom
You tried to come up, you don't keep it on the low
You like a drug, don't like you to call them hoes
I'm trying to break a bitch down like 36 O's
I think I love a big fat A-O-D
Make that bitch cum for free
Look it mommy, shake it
I'm gonna call her, she gon hit my life
Fall in love every time
But if I don't pay she gon leave me
Never had a real reason
All I get is bits and pieces
I never said this shit was easy
I didn't saw this shit was easy
Who am I now
