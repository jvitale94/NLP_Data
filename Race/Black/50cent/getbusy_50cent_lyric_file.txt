Get busy
I'm insane yea, shit changed
I'm the head of that bang, bang
Anywhere gang,
Make it rain, trick
Make it rain
I hold on to mine
And buy more cocaine, I'm
Off the chain
Nigga I ain't playin'
I get it him with the semi nigga
Stun I let it rain
He rap I rap
But we ain't the same
He love a dame
I run a train
Canary yellow rocks in my ring
Everything private, my hoes in my planes
Every now bartender more champaigne
I shawn like crowman's Arizona rain
I stunt when I want
I ain't never gonna change
I go load the wood in my cardian frames
This what happens when a bebe kid,
Blow up, up on out this bitch


I ball out bottles after bottles
'Till I fall out
I stunt, I do it my way
I'm on now, get my money long now
Look here, nigga you ain't got it like me
You don't like me
Get busy get busy
Do somethin
Get busy get busy
You don't like me
Get busy get busy
Do somethin


Tell me why you don't like me
My chain too icy
The diamonds on my right hand
Striking like lightning
Throwing cake on your wife
When she liking the icing and uh
It's not even my birthday
She tellin' me she love me
And I wanna be your happy pusher
Then pulled the beetle in the first place
Nah dance the Ali Key let me hold some
Look 'cause I know you know
And I know you nothing
With your rope in, coat in
Type of shit gonna get wild with no man
Ride a game thing, play the bitch without the ball
It's my night boy better love 'till mor'
I'm a boss plus walking big ballin' and
Talking, benz parking, rims glosin', click closer
Tell her way you drained the bottles
With the towels sparkling
Say money talks, bitch my money talks
Now


I ball out bottles after bottles
'Till I fall out
I stunt, I do it my way
I'm on now, get my money long now
Look here, you ain't got it like me
Doing like me
Get busy get busy
Too stunt
Doing like me
Get busy busy
Too stunt
Doing like me
Get busy busy
Yeah
