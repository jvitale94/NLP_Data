They call my wip, Scrawberry shortcake
But my cake never short, call it tall weight
I got pounds, I don't want no more weight
So umm England, PLEASE, not at all mate
I get money, money I got
Scrawberry, well, cost a whole lot!

That's Scraaaaw-berry milk pink, (Scrawberry!)
In the summer wit a tank and in the winter wit a mink! (Scrawberry!)
Keep a full tank so I go a long way and my dash board clean and my trunk don't stain!

That's Scrawberry, no not Strawberry
Ya'll hit the dealer for the blacks and the blueberries (Scrawberry)
Still my favorite of them all berries (Scrawberry)
Ain't ya average or ya ordinary (Scraw!)
Quick like Nestly
Something light but the bass bang heavy
Can't test ride, can't drive, don't test me
I'm bangin' in ya area, I'm bangin' in ya rezi!
I'm bangin' in ya area, I'm bangin' in ya rezi!
I'm bangin' in ya area, I'm bangin' in ya rezi!
I'm bangin' in ya area, I'm bangin' in ya rezi!
I'm bangin' in ya area, they turning it up like!

That's Scraaaaw-berry milk pink, (Do that there, do that there, do it!) 
In the summer wit a tank and in the winter wit a mink!
Keep a full tank so I go a long way and my dash board clean and my trunk don't stain!
