(Intro)
I'm better than you
What else does she do
Well she will
Bite your face
You may await
Wait too damn long
You saw
Take my time 2010 and 9
Your fans
And make 'em mine

(Verse)
Back at the gate with a red cape and a full flask
20 red bulls ready to trash in this bull fight
You bullshit bull couple of bull
See I got bigger balls
Probably get bigger applause
Strapped on bigger balls it's bigger thicker than yours
Probably fit in your jaws while you liking it off
Think of all the liquor you're pouring
Bottles infinite models you scored prominent models
It caused bought in your cocktails
Reminisce about the whores you hate you date 'em
The tools and vacations you bought take us and take 'em on
Don't gag take it all, relax your man
Shake it off, was a safe place in your mind
With your boys and your toys with a auto tune
I don't know huh you're inaudible don't talk with your mouth full
Don't you look adorable
Tears streaming down, heels leaning up, knees on the ground ,milk streaming up
Words up chuck and get slapped until your face hurts
Should grab your neck and slam your face up into the bass word
Isn't great absurd let you go ape bitch
Till you swallow every word I'm back in the game to tail the nerd
