butterflies and sunshine baby 
I can tell that nature loves you 
not as much I do lately 
you chase all my clouds away 
I'm never go let of ya 
happiness is all around me 
let's run away and build a family 
we can catch a flight today 

you fit like the pieces in the puzzle 
I've been missing 
you feel like I always wanna hug you 
when we're kissing 

I just wanna get much closer 
but it seems so far away 
you could be the one I keep forever 
I'm kinda dreaming 
It just be you and me together 

I just wanna get much closer 
I just wanna hear you say 


DO ME DO ME 
DO ME DO ME DO ME DO ME 
DO ME DO ME 
DO ME DO ME DO ME DO ME 

chilling on an island somewhere 
hummingbird upon my shoulder 
holding on to your hand dearly 
walking in the sunset breeze 

writing my name with yours and 
don't you think it seems so perfect 
everything seems so perfect 
we could do this endlessly 

you fit like the pieces in the puzzle 
I've been missing 
you feel like I always wanna hug you 
when we're kissing 

I just wanna get much closer 
but it seems so far away 
you could be the one I keep forever 
I'm kinda dreaming 
It just be you and me together 

I really wanna get much closer 
really wanna hear you say 

DO ME DO ME 
DO ME DO ME DO ME DO ME 
DO ME DO ME 
DO ME DO ME DO ME DO ME
