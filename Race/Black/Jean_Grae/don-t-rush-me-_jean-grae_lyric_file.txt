[Intro] 
9th, 9th's got them beats that you just sing to for no 
reason 
{*laughs*} 
Sometimes you got to get to know yourself 
You gotta travel a little bit 
Look at yourself from another perspective 
So I try to do that 
Come on 
[Verse 1] 
Listen, there's nothing like knowin' yourself 
Like the way I know that smokin's kind of broken my health 
Like the way I know my flow don't make appropriate wealth 
I can't change that 
But funny I'm sayin' that when it's money I'm aimed at 
I give a fuck if you frame that or quote it (shit) 
I meant what I said cuz I wrote it, point noted 
I know I'm overly sensitive when it comes to, well 
Just about everything 
And I'm so hardheaded, I don't need your help 
Like no advice for these records 'less it's me, myself 
Like I don't ever want to breathe if it requires assistance 
Just, just shut down my system 
I'm a victim of choosin' bad love, bad luck Lucy 
Every man touched seems to be a doozy and plus 
I'm attached to this looseleaf, stand on my two feet 
So it's hard enough to even have to physically move me 
Go ahead, try 
[Hook] 
I know I'm on the right path 
To who I'm gonna be at last 
Don't rush me nigga 
I know I'm wrong and right 
At the same time, both I'm the dark and light 
And they say life needs everything to live 
At the same time I got everything to give 
Just don't rush me 
Don't rush me 
[Verse 2] 
I gotta be more disciplined 
I'm listenin' more to straight logic 
Blockin' random shit that's driftin' in 
Age is a motherfucker (damn right) 
Find myself starin' at the little kids 
Thinkin' "I can beat 'em like a stepmother" 
Creepin' on a come up at thirty soon 
But lookin' twenty ooh 
The food catches up to you now plenty 
Attendin' christenin's of my best friend's children 
And then askin' who's next 
And I'm wishin' for six more wishes for Christmas or 
Kids on the wish list 
Or time machines to be in existence 
I'm a team player, not 
The dry wit is similar to Arizona weather 
Say it, nigga, hot 
Patent leather sole, tappin' at my bowl 
If the album's not platinum then I'll have to rack a gold 
This rappin' ain't for nothin' 
Unless I hold plaques so I can sit up on a boat like Colin, roll that 
And you know that 
[Hook] 
I know I'm on the right path 
To who I'm gonna be at last 
Don't rush me nigga 
I know I'm wrong and right 
At the same time, both I'm the dark and light 
And they say life needs everything to live 
At the same time I got everything to give 
Just don't rush me 
Don't rush me 
[Verse 3] 
See this here is the most serious that I've ever been 
The most clear headed 
My gear fetish clearly needs an accountant 
So if I need I'll smoke 'em all like Dennis Leary in a mountain 
Beef's great though, thanks for addin' more insecurities 
Just as I was findin' my level of maturity 
Just as I was mindin' my business 
Tried to murder Jean's confidence 
But lucky for me, you're all incompetent 
Road block in this, yes 
I see him try to put a stop to my obnoxiousness but 
I stay long winded like sayin' George Papadopoulous 
I know but I write from this heart with this 
So I've got some things to work on 
My moodiness like masturbation gets its jerk on 
My fascination with the fast pace 
Money's encapsulated in my mind space like what a thrill 
Past dated and I know I'm not in last place 
But it's hard to work through it with this masked face 
And maskin' tape on all the windows keeps the cold out 
And everytime I'm layin' down my back breaks because it's old now 
I yell too much, get stressed too quick 
But the best thing about it, I can change that shit 
And still remain who I came down to Earth to be 
It's not Jean Grae, that's just a name, you'll see 
[Hook] 
I know I'm on the right path 
To who I'm gonna be at last 
Don't rush me nigga 
I know I'm wrong and right 
At the same time, both I'm the dark and light 
And they say life needs everything to live 
At the same time I got everything to give 
Just don't rush me 
Don't rush me 
[Outro] 
Please don't make me kill you, I don't want to 
I don't need to go to jail right now 
I got things to do 
Can't be locked up man 
My momma, my momma 
No momma, no, no 
Anyway, yo thanks man 
Thank you 9th 
And we had a beautiful lunch 
Don't be afraid to talk in the back 
Thanks everybody for coming out tonight 
Justus League! What up Flames? 
What up though!

You the man Flames
