Now wait a minute, y'all
This dance ain't for everybody
Only the sexy people, so all you fly mothers
Get on out there and dance, dance, I said

Salt-n-Pepa's here, and we're in effect
Want you to push it back
Coolin' by day then at night working up a sweat
C'mon girls, let's go show the guys that we know
How to become number one in a hot party show

Now push it
Ah, push it, push it good
Ah, push it, push it real good
Ah, push it, push it good
Ah, push it, push it real good

Hey, ow, push it good
Ooh, baby, baby, baby, baby
Ooh, baby, baby, baby, baby
Push it good, push it real good
Ah, push it, ah, push it

Yo, yo, yo, yo, baby-pop
Yeah, you come here, gimme a kiss
Better make it fast or else I'm gonna get pissed
Can't you hear the music's pumpin' hard like I wish you would?

Now push it, push it good
Push it real good, push it good
Push it real good, ah, push it

Get up on this
Get up on this
Get up on this
Get up on this

Boy, you really got me going
You got me so I don't know what I'm doing
Ah, push it, ah, push it

Boy, you really got me going
You got me so I don't know what I'm doing
Ah, push it, ah, push it
Ah, push it, push it, push it, push, it
Push it, push it, push it
