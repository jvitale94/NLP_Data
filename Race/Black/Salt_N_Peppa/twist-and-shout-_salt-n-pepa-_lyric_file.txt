Yo Salt your mic, yo Pepa your mic
Yo Spin you hype, we're deaf you're right
The bass shakin' dancin' all night, booties shakin' from left to right
Salt and Pepa rockin' the mic, so that you might

Shake it up baby now
(Shake it up baby)
You gotta twist and shout
(Twist and shout)
C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon baby now
(Come on baby)
Go ahead and work it on out
(Work it on out)

Work it on out now, baby
(Work it on out now)
You know you look so good
(Look so good)
You really got me going now, boy
(Got me going)
Just like I knew you would
(Like I knew you would)

Hey baby, listen, I think they're playin' our song
What up? You gonna get up? Well shut up and come on
I wanna feel your body close to me, lovin' and holdin' me
Tight like a vice grip squeezin' all over me
Yeah, that's the way, hey, don't get carried away
The other boy do what the record say

And shake it up, baby, now
(Shake it up, baby)
You make me twist and shout
(Twist and shout)
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, baby, now
(Come on, baby)
Work it, work it on out
(Work it on out)

Work that bootie on out now, baby
(Work it on out now)
You know you look so good
(Look so good)
You really got me going now
(Got me going)
Just like I knew you would
(Like I knew you would)

Yeah, gimme gimme gimme
All you got boyfriend, you should be enjoyin'
A sexy girl might ease that antidote to poison
Boys in the jam ask me to dance but I say no chance
I want a man who's advanced in the art of dance

So when we get on a floor he can take me on a tour
And we can do it till the fluid or sweat starts to pour
Down like the rain and the thunderstorm hard and strong
Boy, come on, don't wait too long

You better shake it up, baby, now
(Shake it up, baby)
Twist and shout
(Twist and shout)
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, baby, now
(Come on, baby)
Go ahead and work it on out
(Work it on out)

Yeah, work it on out now, boyfriend
(Work it on out now)
You know you look so good
(Look so good)
You really got me going now with that stuff
(Got me going)
Like I knew you would
(Like I knew you would)

Get higher, baby
H-h-higher, baby
Get higher, baby
Yeah, now break it down

One good twist deserves a better one, a deffer one
We're Salt and Pepa, together we'll have lots of fun
Do it again, babe for the hit parade
'Cuz Spinderella does a hell of a job keepin' the record playin'
Shout like ya just sold your soul to rock 'n' roll
You lost control, go hit the floor

And shake it up, baby, now
(Shake it up, baby)
Come on, twist and shout
(Twist and shout)
Go 'head, go 'head, go 'head, go 'head, baby, now
(Come on, baby)
Go ahead, and work it on out
(Work it on out)

Work it on out now, baby
(Work it on out now)
You know you look so good
(Look so good)
You really got me going now, boy
(Got me going)
Just like I knew you would
(Like I knew you would)

Shake it up, baby, twist and shout
Come on, baby, work it on out
Work it on out now, look so good
Got me going like I knew you would

Shake it up, baby, now
(Shake it up, baby)
Shake it, shake it, shake it, baby, now

Shake, shake, shake, baby, now
(Shake it up, baby)

(Shake it up, baby)
