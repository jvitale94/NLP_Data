I just can't make her happy 
See it's like every other day is like she
Throwing her shit at me
A constant complain about every
Single thing, her hard swagger to maintain 
Shorty driving me insane 
And in the beginning I
Was in it, if you said it I was on it
And even if I thought you give
Me longer I was hoping 
I guess a nigger was hoping thinking about loping 
See I just call it focus, but some might call it open It's like
I'm compromising everything I stood for I'm breaking that every nigger
in the hood know one, way it sell, 
Two, never play yourself, 
Three, it don't matter girl
I throw em out the window 


Cause of you 
Our windows are
Backwards, 
I'd do anything you
Say I'm here for you baby, don't
Have to worry about it A little bit 
Goes a long way Cause If I give you
One, would you want two, 
If I give you two Would you want three 


Somebody say in relationships 
Would be like 50-50 How come I
Feel I'm giving one but not
Receiving any 
Why must you
Make it so hard to play the part 
I put you in the light but yet you
Leave me in the dark And every time 
I think of you before you go back
And every time I think our train is
Straight you jump track and you know 
What the fuck was that? 
You always doing that, 
Let me turn the shit on you 
And see how you react 
It's like I'm compromising everything I stood for 
I'm breaking that every
Nigger in the hood know 
One,way it sell
Two, never play
Yourself, 
Three, it don't matter girl
I throw em out the window 


Cause of you 
Our windows are
Backwards, 
I'd do anything you
Say I'm here for you baby, don't
Have to worry about it A little bit 
Goes a long way Cause If I  give you
One, would you want two, 
If I give you two Would you want three 


If I give an inch watchu wanna the foot
If I give the foot watchu wanna the jaws
If I give the jaws watchu wanna mine
And if I give them  mine
I wanna give you everything you want
I wanna be anything you want
I wanna be everything you need
Am right here for you baby girl
You dont have to worry about a thing...
Ooh..ooh..no..oh


Cause of you 
Our windows are
Backwards, 
I'd do anything you
Say I'm here for you baby, don't
Have to worry about it A little bit 
Goes a long way Cause If I give you
One, would you want two, 
If I give you two Would you want three
