Im a country nigga, and I keep it street,
All I smoke is strong, straight from Section-8,
I got socks on with my house shoes,
I got my baby momas name tattoed,
I got another bitch, with another bitch, mad
Cuz I fucked up her hair doo
Hair weave killer, on a wanted poster
I dance on a white girl, call it john travolota
Ima country nigga, ill fu fu fuck on the sofa,
My whip white with the black top, like sammy sosa,
Girl, if you aint got no money, you better have hustle,
See when I got some money, all I did was add muscle,
Titty two chains, and the two stands for to merge,
Extension cords is when you put together two blunts

Take away the money,
Take away the fame,
Strip to my drawers and u still gonna find the same,
O Country Ass Nigga...
Yeah...
Country Ass Nigga.
Yeah. boy,
Way before the house,
Way before the car,
I was pulling broads and I still was gettin called,
Country Ass Nigga.
Yeah...
Country Ass Nigga.
Yeah. boy,
