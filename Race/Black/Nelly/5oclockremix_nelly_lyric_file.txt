Conversation got boring
You said you’re going to bed soon
So I snuck off to your bedroom
And I thought I’d just wait there (uh)
Until I heard you come up the stairs (uhh)
I pretended I was sleeping (uhh)
And I was hoping

It’s 5 o’clock in the morning

and the streets are … out
came home just to hear your mouth
ain’t trying to run hold up fuck you in the club
I was drunk last night I am still drunk
baby please don’t fight got to get you off my chest
baby came home now I am laying on your chest
lay out this California king watch you making around my bed
I ain’t trying to go away try to see you pull away
try to open my eyes and say

It’s 5 o’clock in the morning
alone and you know you love me bay
when I am on you get the best o me baby
so I am standing on the other side of the mirror
thinking about the shit that I did
try to lock you up try to be no hater
every nigger beside me make you feel better
guess you wanna go
please can you go when the sun come up and ..
It’s 5 o’clock in the morning
let me make it up for you call your momma she know that I fuck with you
cause she know that I get distracted just like your daddy did
he was there when he count it .. I might o it every time ..
