Told her I can split it then make it like a oreo
Yea I put it down down down, let that Shawty low
She ain't gonna ever get a nigga on that morning show

I got her like oh oh oh my Lawd
She takin off my draws
She takin off my shirt
Now it's time to go to work
Boy I hit it til she squirt
She want that ooey but yea
She leanin back in that chair
While I'm grippin onto her hair
While she tell me keep it right there
I'm like Shawty if you give it I'mma take it
And if you want love we gotta make it


I'm focused to the max, now she only here for me
If she ain't on her A game I'mma let her be
And all she do is talk about it so I let her see
Yea lil mama love that deep, now she yelling man OP


She's the most mos focused
She like oh my Lawd
Oh my Lawd
She like oh my Lawd
Oh oh oh my Lawd
She like oh my Lawd
Oh oh oh my Lawd
She like oh my Lawd
Baby why you go so hard?


Yea I know that she a freak, she's a scorpio
Now I got her talkin like she tryna put it onto you
Told her if you wanna be about it, what you talkin for?
Yea you know that I can probably get you where you wanna go

Girl you're like oh oh oh my Lawd
She takin off my draws
She takin off my shirt
Now it's time to go to work
Boy I hit it til she squirt
She want that ooey but yea
She leanin back in that chair
While I'm grippin onto her hair
While she tell me keep it right there
I'm like Shawty if you give it I'mma take it
Now let's go get naked


I'm focused to the max, now she only here for me
If she ain't on her A game I'mma let her be
And all she do is talk about it so I let her see
Yea lil mama love that deep, now she yelling man OP


She's the most mos focused
She like oh my Lawd
Oh my Lawd
She like oh my Lawd
Oh oh oh my Lawd
She like oh my Lawd
Oh oh oh my Lawd
