Some say she's a bitch, she's a liar
Fucking with her is like playing with fire
So I'll say (so I'll say) hey that's my girl (that's my girl)
And Imma be the one that's gon' make her better
And you can always see the two of us together
Cos when I'm going through some things I
Know that she's my daylight
In the middle of the darkness
I can see things clearly
Because she's near me yeah

Aint no way I'm letting her go
See I've been warned by everyone around me
She gon' be the death of me oh yeah
But aint no way I'm letting her go (no)
See all the money in this world don't mean
Nothing without her, nothing without her yeah

So they say, she's a problem
It aint nuttin cos I'm known to be a solver
And I aint worried about what other people call her
So I'll say (so I'll say) I tamed the wild one (I tamed the wild one)
I aint saying I can make nobody perfect
But I can really see what's underneath the surface
Cos when I'm looking in her eyes I
See there's love inside I
Wanna be the one to show her
That I'm truely devoted
She's gonna know it yeah so

Aint no way I'm letting her go
See I've been warned by everyone around me
She gon' be the death of me oh yeah
But aint no way I'm letting her go (no)
See all the money in this world don't mean
Nothing without her, nothing without her yeah

Let me be the reason baby let me be the cause
Let me the only one you let up in your heart
Let me be the picture, sitting in your frame
Let me be your lover, I'll let you be the same


Aint no way I'm letting her go
See I've been warned by everyone around me
She gon' be the death of me oh yeah
But aint no way I'm letting her go (no)
See all the money in this world don't mean
Nothing without her, nothing without her yeah
