Let me live
Let me live
Let me live

Ya'll niggas really know me from the stories I tell (tell)
From the lifestyle I lead and the records I sell (sell)
Caught up in situations detrimental to me
And I been through every one for the world to see
That time is always movin' situations do change
And few don't always work out just the way that we plan
Still stand necessary be my friend and my foe
Either love me or you hate me
That's how the game goes
If it's wrong to be respected never ever say die
Remain strong never neglect to spread my wings and fly
Like you I been through struggles so much stress on my brain
Actin' out my life on stages and still had to maintain
Question my every decision
My intentions were good
Twist the story all around and make me misunderstood
Imagine that, no privacy but that's the price of this fame
Under attack, my destiny to be a soldier through rain

I flow I flow
Like water like water
And my desire
Like fire, like fire
I'm kickin' up dirt
From the earth, the earth
Imaginin' I'm the wind 
Redeliverin' from deeper within

I flow I flow
Like water like water
And my desire
Like fire, like fire
I'm kickin' up dirt
From the earth, the earth
Imaginin' I'm the wind 
Redeliverin' from deeper within

Let me live live
Let me live
In in inside
Inside intelligence
Say it say it say it
What you gotta say
Always ask 
And you will be amazed

Let me live live
Let me live
In in inside
Inside intelligence
Say it say it say it
What you gotta say
Always ask 
And you will be amazed

Just to make it in this world and go against all odds
Come from the gritty, in the city, to a superstar
Number one hit consistently for 10 long years
Put my soul in every project my blood, sweat, and my tears
Y'all know my status Left Eye the baddest
Underestimate don't hate it I keep it lavish
But it don't mean nothin' if I can't find peace of mind
Packin' all distractions away leave 'em behind
Say goodbye part-time small crimes and felonies
A new beginnin' I'm winnin' envision' the breeze
I'm dressed in all white linen and fallin' to my knees
Thankful for all that's been given I'm livin' with ease
Tropical trees 90 degrees please
Do like the birds and the bees and start a family
So reminisce on every line that I wrote
Know that I never will surrender and it's truth that I spoke

I flow I flow
Like water like water
And my desire
Like fire, like fire
I'm kickin' up dirt
From the earth, the earth
Imaginin' I'm the wind 
Redeliverin' from deeper within

Let me live live
Let me live
In in inside
Inside intelligence
Say it say it say it
What you gotta say
Always ask 
And you will be amazed

Let me live live
Let me live
Let me love love
Let me love
Let me learn learn
Let me learn
Let me laugh laugh
Let me laugh

Let me see see
Let me see
Let me sing sing
Let me sing
Let me smile smile
Let me smile
Let me ask ask
Let me ask

Let me live
Let me live
Let me live
Let me live
