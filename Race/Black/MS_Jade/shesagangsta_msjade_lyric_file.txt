see me in the source book bitch frozen rings
never bin a follower always bin a leader
y'all to need is get down on ya knees
when you agreed I'm a gangsta
see me in a ball wit my niggaz
Rowdy little dudes ain't afraid to pull the trigger
get shit trucked I'm a fuckin' icon
niggaz in the streets whispering 'bout my rock
cos I'm the broad from the east
smelling like Gucci and envy linen pants with
the crease
ya wanna piece i don't think ya hand ready
c 55 but i used to push the shell in
fucked up tracks which y'all just rap
never touch paper most a y'all just act high these flights pimp rap
must tell y'all the truth i get it in
but y'all messed around in the boot
what the fuck y'all suck coming all y'all smuts
poppin' up worldwide everywhere like starbucks
what the fuck y'all suck coming all y'all smuts
poppin' up worldwide everywhere like starbucks


she's a gangsta not a prankster y'all
not a follower but a leader now can y'all feel that
 she's a gangsta girl, she's a gangsta girl
 now can y'all feel dat
 she's a gangsta girl, she's a gangsta girl


i got a sick giff, roll me a big spliff,
crazy when the mic palm in my black fist
you do it like you, i do it like dis
ms jade powerful the project piss
now how y'all want play, spit it for the big pay
i leave dat ass up in smoke like eminem and dre
semi auto a.k, do the shit the philly way
we roll out the ? just to get away
best 'bout time we settle this
up in the club throwin' bows acting ghetto-ish
and if i stop I'm a still be a rebel chick,
hey you fuckers lookin' quick
puffin' in a tin of it be the case like puffy did
legistyle I'm poppin' big , when I'm gone trust me I'm a still live
take but I'd rather give you fuckin' with the bigger kids,
bigger ones, bigger funs, bigger foods,
timbaland give the beats




choosing down 95 with a cup in my hand
hot grills large bills top up in the rubber band
got the anger math, wont let 'em burn me out
'cos I'm a strong black women ya grown black woman
games do i really play 9-5 bin paid
pills are the grim shit, never fuck widda trays
i don't care if it bothers you I'm still gonna blaze
so sick like a virus that never goes away
hey hold ya breath you can smell the success
spit 16 if the pit pat on your chest
yes I'm so blessed ya cats is so stressed
yeh the streets bin talkin' 'bout my pin a due the rest
future mapped out, money linked all in
I'm a saturate the game then sink y'all in
snakes fates and dick riders what i despise
out to take it all over and will not compromise
