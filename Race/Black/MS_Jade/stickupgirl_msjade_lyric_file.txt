These niggaz shook and timid bang just to bin it
living probably zero and rats runnin deniro
I'm sick makin em settle like cheap tricks
I've the right to be cocky, long, lanky or stocky
I went to da lobby charge me wid assault and all robberies
Snatch they souls, ryde em on they pry
Show dem how to hold they crutches, spit like I was a guy
They wanna take ? they bleed just like i bleed
I ain't the same my game is at a much faster speed
I'm Ms Jade y'all flowin thru the rainfall
Like thunder this gon be a hot summer
I got it figured out, go da regular route
Cos short cuts only end up in short bucks
Get the dough and just stack, leavin em feelin like track,
Cheaper dan rat my damn voice platinum

Down with me runnin that new chick
Crashin' like a new whip for insurance money
It ain't funny down really runnin widda young ?
You wanna cold chattin' pissin' on a stove like a weak bladder
Come and see me switch flows up like this
Makin' y'all backflip and try to get my twist
Rocked up powder bakin soda and flour
Gettin' paid by the hour, see it proper devour
Ms J-a-d-e from the p-h-i ruin girls and guys ? 
Yxy cats sayin' too much and doin' too much
Never purchase but be quick to run and go get a dutch
I'm the brotha relate to never lie or forsake you
Gloves on in the ring im the chick that could take you
Stayin' here for awhile came prepared 4 da miles
keep it cool, so the only thing I draw is a crowd

Take it back to da skates 2 will is cool to spit bananas like Ima ape
I'm da best in da grape, I expect you to hate, but wait
Hey aint even heard me had ya, blasha forfits, best bit trash dat
Open your mind I'll show you a different aspect, 
I ain't a rap princess, im a rap pimpstress
Yeah I pay off the witness and leave em chilled like christmas

Hundreds on your nice damn. told ya I'ma aiight man
