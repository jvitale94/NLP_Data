Dawgs that I called my friends
Praying for all my friends
Things I do for my friends
We miss you, A'Yo! Kato!



Started of two dawgs wit the same goals
Nuttin but two dawgs walking the same road
Two different cultures, but had the same heart
Enjoyed seeing the light, but lived in the dark
5th album bumped heads in the parking a lot
Was a pride brother, didn't like to bark a lot
Came correct, when he came, he gained respect
So I gave respect, we shared the same respect
Two names in wreck now on the circles
Two brothers with good heart, but if you start, two brothers that will hurt you
You know how that dirt, hittin four corners
Earh! Earh! Earh! Earh!, right back upon us
God tried to warn us but sometimes we don't see
When I first heard I'm like "this cant be, you all niggas is buggin
Got the wrong information or suttin, please tell me that these niggas is fronting
God No"

There left unsaid dawg we wasn't finished
Never got to say thank you for being a friend
Dawgs! for Life! and you, will role to the end
Held dawg down didn't let a day go by
Everytime dawg came to the Chi (what!)
I was good, trips out to Phoenix with the scrambling squad
If I come back to Phoenix I'm like, damn its hard
To accept the fact (Uh), that you wont be coming back (Uh)
But I hope your coming back (Uh), cause I wont accept the fact (Uuhh!)
When you came to New York, You had to come to the crib
And vise-versa (Yeah!), that's just how we did
Remote-control cars (What!), we would race all day
It was adventure, we would chase all day (Yeah!)
So I'm not gonna say good-bye ma nigga (uh uh)
Instead I would rather (Rather) focus on the time we spent together
That's what matters (for real)
