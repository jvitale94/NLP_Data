Yeah, yeah, yeah (grrrr)
Uh, yeah don't get it twisted
This rap shit, is mine
Motherfucker, it's not, a fucking, game
Fuck what you heard
It's what you hearing
It's what you hearing (listen)
It's what you hearing (listen)
It's what you hearing (listen)


X gon' give it to ya
Fuck wait for you to get it on your own
X gon' deliver to ya
Knock knock, open up the door, it's real
Wit the non-stop, pop pop and stainless steel
Go hard getting busy wit it
But I got such a good heart
Then I'll make a motherfucker wonder if he did it
Damn right and I'll do it again
'Cause I am right so I gots to win
Break bread wit the enemy
But no matter how many cats I break bread wit
I'll break who you sending me
You motherfuckers never wanted nothing
But your life saved,
bitch that's for the light day
I'm getting down, down
Like a nigga said, "Freeze!"
But won't be the one ending up on his knees
Bitch, please
If the only thing you cats did is came out to play
Stay out my way, motherfucker


First we gonna rock, then we gonna roll
Then we let it pop, don't let it go
X gon' give it to ya
He gon' give it to ya
X gon' give it to ya
He gon' give it to ya


Ain't never gave nothing to me
But every time I turn around
Cats got they hands out wanting something from me
I ain't got it so you can't get it
Let's leave it at that 'cause I ain't wit it
Hit it wit full strength
I'm a jail nigga
So I face the world like it's Earl in the bullpen
You against me, me against you
Whatever, whenever
Nigga, fuck you gon' do?
I'm a wolf in sheep clothing
Only nigga that you know who can chill
Come back and get the streets open
I've been doing this for nineteen years
Niggas wanna fight me? Fight these tears
I put in work and it's all for the kids
But these cats done forgot what work is (uh-huh!)
They don't know who we be
Looking! But they don't know who they see, nigga


First we gonna rock, then we gonna roll
Then we let it pop, don't let it go
X gon' give it to ya
He gon' give it to ya
X gon' give it to ya
He gon' give it to ya


Aiiyo where my niggas at?!
I know I got them down in the game
Give em love and they give it back
Talk too much for too long (what?!)
Don't give up you're too strong (what?!)
A dog to bow bow hug it (yeah!)
Shout-out to niggas that done it (come on!)
And it ain't even about the dough
It's about getting down for what you stand for yo (for real)


First we gonna rock, then we gonna roll
Then we let it pop, don't let it go
X gon' give it to ya
He gon' give it to ya
X gon' give it to ya
He gon' give it to ya
