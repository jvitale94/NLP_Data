"I'm recording right now mothafucka"
"Hey yo, niggas can't touch me Kid"
"What was that god?"
"I said niggas can't touch me kid."

Uhhh...aha..
Niggas cant touch me kid
Niggas cant touch me kid
Niggas cant touch me kid

Aint no way for me to say just how deep the flow gets
Still wakin up in cold sweats, over old threats
And I done did more time than a clock, from the hallow to the rock
I represent on every block
Its the Dizark! Straight out the Grizound! 
And from now on this is how Shizits goin' Dizown!
Clizown, come through squashin toes.
Don't even breathe cuz in jail you was washin clothes.
Get in front of hoes and start fakin' G, as you tell it you gettin dough like a bakery
Makin' me Schemin plots at yo ass like a dream I put that head to bed and you can dream a lot!
Funny shit is before I shot tha nigga, you shoulda seen how the bitch came up out tha nigga!
Now I got tha nigga but I could run up in em made em say "Daddy" before I put the gun up in em
One up in em, two three, empty the clip, Have his whole head lookin like a busted lip
And I skip, cuz I can't stand another case
Went to his wake so I could laugh at the look on his mother's face
Even though I know it ain't shit funny about knockin' a nigga off just to get money
I still do what I gots to and just be grateful that I neva got you cuz I woulda SHOT YOU!

Yeah, you know how I'm livin' nigga
Straight up ruthless, let's leave yo man truthless, cuz ain't nothin givin nigga 
I been gruddy cuz just long as I can remember since 1970 the eighteenth of December
Earl Simmons, the bastard that nobody wanted was born
Niggas showed me a joint made em run it, it's on.
Can't a bank around the way say I ain't stuck it
Quick as I cap a body I can be one, so fuck it!
I ain't got shit to lose but my life
Plug you in the gut and watch the blood ooze down my knife
I laugh at death cuz to me it's funny
Don't give a fuck about shit, what matters to me is Money!
Sonny, I could teach yo ass a trick or two about stackin the dough, mackin a ho' and what the bitch'll do
I drove a bitch until the bitch is worthless 
Have her suckin my mans dick and make it look good on the surface
A nigga get the same treatment
I'm leavin' guts on walls, and brains all over the cement
But no remorse for the corpse cuz I still kick em
He ain't bleedin' enough so I stick em
And I will have another body
Kinda like how I feel when I'm blowin up another party
And shit is crackin' in the hood now so I'm good now, talkin' bout you good now? Oh you good? Hahhh

Plenty of niggas know dirty is how I do em
Push buckshots from a 30 right through em
Cuz ain't none of yall muhfukkas built for war
And I lay down the law when I spray down ya door
Fuck around and my name'll be ninety five be 64 eleven on the three and a half to seven
But even up north I put niggas to waste so if you wanna stop the violence
GET THE FUCK OUT MY FACE!
The open door, peeps hit the floor, 
Bitches is fuckin but I sleeps with the sawed off!
I got shit to do, crews to rake, moves to make, 
Wait for the news to break, I got dues to take
I don't joke cuz jokers is cards
And cards are what I pull
Infrared with the clip full, no leash on my pitbull
This shit is hot like the wax off a candle stick
But how I handle shit, is to dismantle shit (DunDunDunDunDuhDaDa)
Like Popeye and it's spinach time, runnin through niggas like a tape at the finish line
What ya crew gonna do when i put the pressure on?
And it hurts wanna be gangstas in skirts?
And the bitch is comin' all up out the nigga!
One false move and they mom's will read about the nigga
And they girls will be without the nigga
Matta fact, don't try the money throw ya joints up, just scrap
