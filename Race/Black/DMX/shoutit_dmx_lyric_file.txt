Shout it
If you know God then you gonna be alright
Shout it
If you know God and you know what he's like
Shout it
If you know God then just jump and shout it
Shout it

Time wastin'
All things that I'm chasin'
Eatin' but don't like what I'm tastin'
Every day I'm gonna want it
104
Have me wondering
But then I wanted it for
Keep down the roll pass, self-destructive
What's my fuck shit?
You know I am for something

Lord let me know if my suffering will be in vain
Lord how much longer will it be?
Lord how much longer will it stay?
Lord how much loner won't the pain let me feel good?

If you don't got what they mean
Then shout it
If you know that you gonna be alright
Shout it
If you don't got it and you know what's it like
Shout it
If you know about it just shout it
Shout it

I'm a try harder
I know the only way to make it
Is going to my father
Stay right beside me
Where is right and love
And for me
They will tie me up
I'm lie top on, top on
She was right on time
But I was so happy to see her
It had me crying
You enjoy it
No you got to save you, save you
Starting to be changing
Never hate you
Look you wanna shout more?
I think you wanna live more
You can do it out more
If you wanna dip more
This is what I live for
This is what I do
It ain't for me
It's for you

If you don't got what they mean
Then shout it
If you know that you gonna be alright
Shout it
If you don't got it and you know what's it like
Shout it
If you know about it just shout it
Shout it

If you don't got what they mean
Then shout it
If you know that you gonna be alright
Shout it
If you don't got it and you know what's it like
Shout it
If you know about it just shout it
Shout it

Where's your head at?
We know where it is
