We ain't kids baby
We get down like that
It's what it is baby, straight biz baby
We ain't kids baby
We get down like that


Slipping and falling,
This time it got a nigga calling
Up to the lord where I'm crawling
All my nigga getting tired up
Slipping and falling, slipping and falling
Slipping and falling,
This time it got a nigga calling
Up to the lord I'm crawling
All my nigga getting tired up
Slipping and falling,


Check it
More money, more problems
I thought more money would solve them
I spent more money in Harlem
Than Frank Lucas did before the boys dropped
Now shit done changed
I don't feel it, shit look strange!
I realized shit ain't the same
At the end of the day, shit ain't the game
Nigga go and do it, best slip and fell
Went to the hood, took a trip to hell
Deal when I should, swore my shit sell
Always knew I could, so I did well


Slipping and falling,
This time it got a nigga calling
Up to the lord where I'm crawling
All my nigga getting tired up
Slipping and falling, slipping and falling
Slipping and falling,
This time it got a nigga calling
Up to the lord I'm crawling
All my nigga getting tired up
Slipping and falling,


If y'all only knew what my life was like
And what I'm going through
Maybe you'd think before you talk,
You gotta crawl before you walk
Think having money is the answer
Money ain't nothing but another form of cancer
Or you can do is watch me die
You don't wanna watch me try
So watch me fly!
But you gonna do is watch me fly
Do my thing from that big stage in the sky
Lord, please, hold me down!
Cause now everybody wanna know me now


Slipping and falling,
This time it got a nigga calling
Up to the lord where I'm crawling
All my nigga getting tired up
Slipping and falling, slipping and falling
Slipping and falling,
This time it got a nigga calling
Up to the lord I'm crawling
All my nigga getting tired up
Slipping and falling,


Please help me! Which way do I go?
Life to book which page do I show?
Cause I know, can't show them all
Even though I slipped and fell I won't fall
Get it? Ok you don't some of y'all will
But most of y'all won't
I'm a keep living life being a man that God made me
I know only he can save me!


Slipping and falling,
This time it got a nigga calling
Up to the lord where I'm crawling
All my nigga getting tired up
Slipping and falling, slipping and falling
Slipping and falling,
This time it got a nigga calling
Up to the lord I'm crawling
All my nigga getting tired up
Slipping and falling,

Aaaaaaaah!
I won't fall, I don't wanna fall
I wish you knew, I wish you fucking knew
I wish, aha.
