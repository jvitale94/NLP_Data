Started off at the bark off and I'm a stay with it
Have I got a dark side, call it a monster
'Cause it comes out when I wants ta
If you had knew half of what I did the nightmares would haunt ya
And nigga I'm a get you I want ya
Run up for your life go on your life
Whether it's wrong or right it's on tonight


We gon' cash it out right, cash it out right, cash it out right, hit it
We gon' cash it out right, cash it out right, cash it out right, let's go
We gon' cash it out right, cash it out right, cash it out right, hit it
We gon' cash it out right, cash it out right, cash it out right, let's go


Hey yo cavy this 20 grand, been for niggas with bandanas
Cock a rock hammer, niggas gang bang, pull out and bang bang
Wipe it off lick it down, you ready for fame
We get to them from the club to the hood
After 2 drinks, you're up to no good
It's not a fucking game I sure hope you understood
Dead and you mad knocking on wood


We gon' cash it out right, cash it out right, cash it out right, hit it
We gon' cash it out right, cash it out right, cash it out right, let's go
We gon' cash it out right, cash it out right, cash it out right, hit it
We gon' cash it out right, cash it out right, cash it out right, let's go


You walk these dogs now they got leashes on
Before your man is a rapper, the pieces on 'em
Got 'em laid up in the casket the grease is on
Eventually you slow down, the sticks is on 'em
The way you talking to them 'cause we both grown men
Fuck if you want one, I want 10
And if we got a problem I'm a let you know then
I'm going in, I go in


We gon' cash it out right, cash it out right, cash it out right, hit it
We gon' cash it out right, cash it out right, cash it out right, let's go
We gon' cash it out right, cash it out right, cash it out right, hit it
We gon' cash it out right, cash it out right, cash it out right, let's go
