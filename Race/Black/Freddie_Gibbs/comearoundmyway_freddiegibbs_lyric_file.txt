What the street life will make you do
Follow me lemme show you how we grind, how we stack our pay
Fuck Tomorrow cause we livin' for today
Come around my way

I'm tired of dealin' with this constant stress
The only thing guaranteed to a nigga is death
So we run the risk of gettin' arrested
But it's hard gettin' money in my hood cause the block congested
Niggas gettin' me to pull out the vests
If you scared of gettin tested
Homie this isn't something you shouldn't mess with
I saw some fatal images when I was eleven
That's when my uncle got addicted to the shit he was sellin'
And I just took it as a lesson and learned from his mistakes
I'm a keep my faith in god til I catch my break
They say my momma's first born turned out to be a thug nigga
A bad example for my brother and my little sister
I could do better and I knew that shit
I had a couple opportunities I blew that shit
But being lord of the streets will make you do that shit
You get a job go to school and shit
I'd rather move that brick


You think you know but you ain't got no clue
What the street life will make you do
Follow me lemme show you how we grind, how we stack our pay
Fuck Tomorrow cause we livin' for today
Come around my way

Come and take a lil' trip to my hood
And see that everything ain't all good
If I could turn around my life I would
This is owned by the arabs and asians
In the city it's 90 percent black
The mayor is caucasian
I ain't prejudice I just tell it how it is
This is one of the worst places you can raise yo kids
Cause instead of buildin' more schools they buildin' more prisons
Our tax dollars is feeding all these greedy politicians
They sittin'; up gettin'; fat while we starve in the hood
The unemployment rate is bonkers ain't no job in the hood
If you ain; t working a job then you movin' some work
Stickin'; these needles, pimpin'; these bitches, or doin' some dirt
It's amazing what motherfuckers will do for the murk
You get to comfortable your whole crew will get murked
You got your ticket out the hood I suggest you get up on it
And pray for the future but we livin'; for the moment
Whatever's necessary I'm a do it til they drop my body in the cemetery
