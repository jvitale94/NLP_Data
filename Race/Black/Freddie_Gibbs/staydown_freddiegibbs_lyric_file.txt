Jumped on that ass 65 and take that trip back to Gary
Granny just passed, my uncle 'bout here smoking blast
But I still could fuck babies crib I gots to get to this cash
Forgive me father cause I'm so wrong
But I know through your ghost in my mind been doing it for so long
Been no waddle when working and the lights bizarre we could barely hold on
So I took off that pauldron wake up that york and got my role on
Then I hit myself with reasons little J's and Jesus pieces
Fresh lights and a brand new polo
LP nigga take that logo in the club it's like a ho show
These ho sure often meeting
And the bitches in my past they just didn't know what I could be
Freddie G, hit the booth pick up my penny
And I pimp it like right consistent
And the rugers and the beeper, my ruger my life expanded
For at least 10 more shots should I get going or get gut
But on the other hand I got a burnt hand and then a rubber band on my


I've been up, baby I've been down
Feels good enough
Baby ain't enough in my town
Gotta get my things right
So I can start the day right
Cause I fucked up
Baby I been fucked round
And it feels good enough
Ain't enough in my town
Shawty get my things right
So I can start the day right

We been to corners and caprices
We cut thousand Caddilacs that don't check I'm cashin that
And I'm chocking smoking on that gasoline
And also huff back on my hoopdie
But my feet just got petite
Had a dream that I would get rich and famous all up on this rapping shit
And the older niggas laughing me I'm a gonna make it happen bitch
And you can't used to write on my raps and dead is the synonym bro
And say my nigga check this I'm gonna check this when I get home
Be lil crazy paper do what I gotta take to make it
Cause enough of these CD's and MP3s
Tryna to shake these haters
Plus I slanging just to maintain the gimmick investigation
Every year niggas only fear the face cases
Living in this industry ghetto please come with smiley faces
But I feel like fuck all these rappers they up on no altercation
Baby face gangster I earn my stripes out on the devil's playground
Peace to all my real niggas that stay down
