Working while I got some prices on my license
A nigga tried to green light me, but I wasn't going
I used to lay up with this bitch
I used to flip and didn't really give a shit about a nigga flowin'
She was contendin', tryna ran up to her and break out
You could see her in the kitchen whippin' with the soda
I bought a ounce of cocaina for I bent her over
And I remember when the broads used to put me out
Cars I was sleepin' out
Pill hella heavy, hella bars I can't even count
LA county jail and got my moms here to bail me out
Rap game break your homies hearts if you leave 'em out
Dope game'll leave you with a charge if you gettin' out
Government will fuck a nigga dreams, never live 'em out
I'm trapping on the blade, hella cards I was sweeping out
Rap game break your niggas heart out if you leave 'em out


I bet you got it twisted, you don't know who to trust
So many player-hatin' niggas tryna sound like us
I say these bitches got it twisted they don't know who to fuck
So many player-hatin' niggas tryna shine like us
Say they ready, I don't think they know it
Yeah, yeah
Say they ready, I don't think they know it

Straight to hell where these niggas goin'

Yeah, lifestyles of the insane, bang
Cost a little extra tryna be a real nigga
I thought a record contract would get the rent paid
Freddie Kane world tour fuck your deal, nigga
And all the niggas jumped off, that was your loss
And they forgot who was the boss and covered all costs
But yesterday a 50 package got 'em all off
I UPS it on the ground, bet they all off
The pages of a psychopath
And nowadays I never write 'em, just recite 'em, yeah
I put the lighter to the fire, and ignite it, yeah
My neighbor used to hit my alley just to buy a bag
And I remember when the broads used to put me out
Cars I was sleepin' out
Pill hella heavy, hella bars I can't even count
LA county jail and got my here moms here to bail me out
Rap game break your homies heart out if you leave 'em out


I bet you got it twisted, you don't know who to trust
So many player-hatin' niggas tryna sound like us
I say these bitches got it twisted they don't know who to fuck
