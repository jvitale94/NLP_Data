


I know we made an agreement
Yeah we both path
Just to do all our thing
Krazy


Staring at the world thru versace lenses
Moving Tony with my homie cause he's bout the business
If we make it to a birdie then we cop Benz
Sound good until a nigga end up in the prison
Look at me I'm the definition of detrimental
Off the driver's side there's... busting about the...
Send a witness to hospital for my acquittal
And my bullets blind you're riding with em would you be dying with you
Killing with the baby face nigga spray the place
Gang member, police got me in their database
Before I drop it in the water get it yay and taste
Bout a quarter banger homie over call it paper way
We don't even speak on the word beef, we let it be
Right back on they ass been a psychopath since seventeen
Nigga ain't no piece on the east street waste
Used to burn shit and the shermsticks my life style


My life style krazy, Luxury condos and bad hoes Krazy!
Hop out the Porsche Jump up in the lambos Krazy!
Living up no sleep this cold street amaze me
Packing that big clip when shit get krazy!
Luxury condos and bad hoes Krazy!
Hop out the Porsche up jump in the lambos krazy!
And when the song get pussy niggas get faded
Packing that big clip when shit get krazy!


Niggas die every day, one day if I'm next
One foot in the condo, one in the projects
Break it all down yeah got dissect
This bullet is something that you ain't able to digest
Get this income is the outcome
So I'm a finish this work and finish the album
And I know them people got it out for me
End of the day is looking out for me
Me and fuck you if you doubt with me
Bad bitches blowing weed on the balcony
I'm just enjoying up minities
Business man, with dope boy tendencies
I take shit to the extremity
Rest in peace to my enemies
I don't want it if is under a hundred and don't faze me




105 east bound, feeling like a king real
Vibe play my feet down
On the blocks gluts bustin like a grey hound
You're my life style crazy on this play ground
Still hangin with my niggas from the sand box
We on hit it and you know we got them lamb chops
Rock pushin rhymes like wait now
Stack rock bitches ready for the takedown
Krazy I just go no breaks now
My six teens a brick you can't break down
Yeah I'm so solid in this world of mine
Stay on my grind daily I don't really know the time
Watch full of diamonds in my chain dancing
Don't risk don't reach, you don't even chance it
Man down you don't get no second chances
Play haters you need to think about the circumstances
