Make that Hardcore thuggish shit, could care less if the bitches love it
But they do cause I stay True, They Rushing Takin Pictures of Us
Gangsta Trill as Bobby Seale, bitch I'm the New Rendition of Him
Real Nigga, Reputable Reputation
Pockets Get too low, I Heat the Stove up with no hesitation
Find a Block and pick a spot to eat like I got reservations,
Lay you to rest if you can't relate to my new revelation,
No this ain't no Coke rap, no I don't promote that,
I simply illustrate my life I live it as I wrote that,

And yea I served some geekers, took some trips, and brought some dope back,
But that don't make me harder than nobody you could quote that,
I represent the Loc'd out, low-class, 20 dollar dope bags,
Drop you for yo motherfucking last . with' our broke ass.
Either you the server or the mothefucker gettin' served,
Could'ntwait to load it in his pipe and let it burn, Str8 kill
