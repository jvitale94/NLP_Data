Outta jail with a lot of strong
A nigga started from a fuckin' song
I chopped it up and put my niggas on
But ain't nobody put a nigga on
My Glock-9 put a nigga on
Two squares gotta get em gone
Hot song chickens talk on the telephone

And I got em for the way low
I stay low
The bricks or the bow wow
The yayo
You niggas better stay low
Like way low
For the bricks or the bow wow
The yayo
For the Pesos

Fuck nigga
I got 10 bitches and all of em turnt out
Fuck nigga
10 in rotation and all of em burnt out
Fuck nigga
10 pack of yayo the waiter just touched down
Fuck nigga
Hit me before 10 o-clock my shit shut down

Tom Brady with the touchdown
Fuck nigga play with me and get fucked 'round
The postman bring the package out the truck now
A thousand pounds worth a milli when it touch down
The new seats in the truck got it plushed out
Remember when my shit went back and then you rushed out
Hold you to knife at the bus stop
Now I got all these bitches assed and their titties bout to bust out
Fuck nigga
I got 10 bitches and all them obedient
My hoes drive Porches and Benzes and Beemers shit
Freakin' your bitch in my suite, who you sleepin' with
Still with the thugs I was thuggin' and thieving with
Since '96 on some payphone and beeper shit
Used to get hoes on some payphone and beeper shit
Freakin' your bitch in my suite, who you sleepin' with

And I got em for the way low
I stay low
The bricks or the bow wow
The yayo
You niggas better stay low
Like way low
For the bricks or the bow wow
The yayo
For the Pesos

Fuck nigga
I got 10 bitches and all of em turnt out
Fuck nigga
10 in rotation and all of em burnt out
Fuck nigga
10 pack of yayo the waiter just touched down
Fuck nigga
Hit me before 10 o-clock my shit shut down
