Just a kid from 145th and Lennox Ave
Harlem, USA trying to make his way in the world ya heard?
Ya know through the trial of tribulations that life brings
I lost some friends, incarcerated, some are gone forever
Ya know you cant expect everything from everybody
So get up get out and get somethin, thats what I did


Before I had the hammer cocked
A Santana rock
Little Gerv, Grandpa Jerry, Grandma Doc (thats my fam)
Uncle Carl, Uncle Ted, Uncle Steve, Uncle Bill,
Cousin Steve, Cousin Bill up on the hill now
My Aunt Normy, I don't speak to my Aunt Deita
Or my Cousin Bashiba, love my Mother Fredricka
Neighbour Freida, daughter Raven and Nika
Down another doorbell was that nigga Warden Nell
He gave birth to the best emcee you never heard
Lever after lever and was clever with whatever word
Derek Armstead, Bloodshed from C.O.C
He did damage, road managed my G.O.D
Aka Duke Da God, he was stupid hard
16, the bitch dream had stupid cars
Cut the '68, hooptie '75
Still drives some bullshit, I don't know why
I loved the nigga though, for him put cris in the air
First one that diss him in here, I swear I'll risk my career
Thats a fact they ain't talking no rap shit
I'm talking that mack clip, niggas will backflip, act sick
My dude study the sabbath
No beef, veggie nigga, maybe some catfish
He could have my house, he could keep my mauries
He could drive my cars, this a eastside story

(Thats why my dudes love me I let them do them.
You either gonna be rich or famous fuckin wit me, probably both.
If you happen to brush shoulders wit me by accident,
play lotto, nine out of ten times you gonna win nigga.)


To play the game, sure to win

I sacrificed, I rolled the dice
I love the hood, I love my life


See a boss I prepared to be
When I walk away from a confrontation I ain't scared of you I'm scared of me
I got a gun, you don't so it flares you'll see
After that a 5,000 volt chair for me
So I move carefully, niggas don't care for me
Who care I don't, you share I wont
Calm down (uhuh) breathe again
I don't do extortion unless I wanna recieve an end
Talk to my money, first time I heard her speak (what she say)
Thats word to me, told me I deserve to eat (what happened)
Moved to a killa ave, right from a murder street (what you did)
Rocked adida forms even though they hurt my feet (thats fucked up)
I don't look in the sky, never mind stars
You also find stars, right behind bars
Snazz, Black, Do' on house arrest
Zeke, shiek, wont even throw out the rest
They wanted my ass right alongside zeke
Turn myself in, nope play hide and go seek
I'm gone, put the clip in the chrome
Yeah I'm just like a fly, see the shit that I'm on
And, hour after hour I would chill at the afterhours
Where they flash the power, no bath or shower
In that same spot, realize math is power
So I pointed the mansion, that is ours
