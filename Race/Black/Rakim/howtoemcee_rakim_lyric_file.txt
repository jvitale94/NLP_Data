

Look what ya'll made me do


This is your koran or bible
To be a true emcee icon or idol
The contents you put in your songs are vital
Like training for the ufc you want a title
Slam thoughts on a canvas flip em and pin em metaphors and similes and synonyms in em
Spit heat around the town the more you get it heard till you spit at 2000 miles before it hit a curve
Then float your rhymes and your rap pages word play punch lines and catch phrases
Heat spots with players and ballers new game street talk straight off the corners new slang
I got heat for crowds for those that pursuit it
Spitters I show you flow till your vocals are through it
I m showing you freestyle just focus into it
If you a gee I'll show you how to cope when you do it



Forever sick like catching aids is
In a class of greatness for magic phrases
My predicates last for pages every letter fit trend setter like fashion statements
When folks get a sign and a hope forever
I wrote some of the illest rhymes ever put to gether
Soon as I make em rappers take em analyze em for days and para phrase em
I'm back hip hoppers
I'm back to spit some documents
Raps hit the block it's a wrap it's the apocalypse
The hood give my rap flow names like nine eleven and crack cocaine
I hit the building it gets hotter in em
It's like birds most rappers don't know how to flip em
I got hip em get hop and show em how to spit em I bust a rhyme then I school em for for free I scholarship em
Chorur:song the competition know the deal your not ready now
Because your dealing with the R know how it's going down this is it kid your so sick with your skills your flow goes right in you can kill rap
It's hard since you can flip it isnt it bars it's infinite so ra deliver it far different
Hard lyric and part instruments start spitting the articulate ya'll rhythms get
Till every syllable you drop is pivotal
It's not original it's not as memorable
I'll lyrical till hes so popular they sick of you
Pandemic a threat level five it's critical
Kill em off with a word like euthanasia
Till it spread to the youth in asia
In the booth I'm major my music monumental I'm a mogul
You gonna make sence I'm gonna show you
You got to put the life in them lines make the hear sight to the make your flow tighter brighter design
So if the mic is your grind then biting s a crime especially if a ghost writers writing your rhymes.



It don matter if I ain't on the page
You gonna tell me what you want
I give it to you the way you want it show you how to flow and how to rip any phrase you you want you just keep your eye on me I show you how to emcee
If it's wack ordinary displays you want tell what you want I give it to you the way you want show you how to flow and how to rip any stage you on I can show you how to emcee like I got a degree
