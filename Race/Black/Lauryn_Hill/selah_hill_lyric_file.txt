no matter how we remain in denial, yeah
Wasting time, replacing time with each empty excuse
but that'll only work a little while
Coping with despair, knowing you're not there
ashamed to just admit I've been a fool
So I blame it on the son, run away from everyone
hoping to escape this ridicule
Trapped in misery, wrapped so miserably
and this deception, I wear it like a skin
Dying to maintain, oh I keep trying to explain
a heart that never loved me to begin
Oh I'm such a mess, I have no choice but to confess
that I've been desperately trying to belong
Lieing to myself and everybody else
refusing to admit my right was wrong, and then he came

And then he came
Selah, oh and it means
Praise and meditation, and then he came
Selah, oh and it means
Did you think about that, and then he came
Selah, oh and it means
Praise and meditation, and then he came
Selah, oh and it means
That it is seen

How beautiful is fruit still in denial of its roots
my guilty heart behaves so foolishly
This treason from within that reasons with my sin
won't be happy till it sees the death of me
Selfishly addicted to a life that I depicted
conflicted cause it's not reality
Oh what's left of me, I beg you desperately
cause me to agree with what I know is best for me
Please save me from myself, I need you, save me from myself
please save me from myself so I can heal
The chocies that I've made, oh have been nothing but mistakes
what a wasted use of space, should I die before I wake
In all of my religion, I've fortified this prison
obligated to obey the demands of bad decisions
Please save me from myself, I need you
save me from myself, please save me from myself so I can heal

And then he came
Selah, oh and it means
Praise and meditation, and then he came
Selah, oh and it means
Did you think about that, and then he came
Selah, oh and it means
Praise and meditation, and then he came
Selah, oh and it means
That it is seen

And then he came
And then he came, then he came, then he came
And then he
And then he came
