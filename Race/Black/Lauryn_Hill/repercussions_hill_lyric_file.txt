Little bitty baby girl 
And when I look at why looking so glad 
In a racist world 
Now it’s a difficult process 
The matter is of perception 
When I look in the mirror what do I see 
Is it my reflection? 


Seein' repercussions (talkin bout the things we do) 
Ya need to know the repercussions (things can come right back to you) 
Look at them repercussions (what goes around comes around) 
Hey repercussions 

See I was born into this 
In another space in time 
Time has moved on a death has grown closer 
Surely has blown my mind (blown my mind) 
Ain’t that a bitch...the way the world spins around (spins around spins around spins around) 
Everything everything everything that I said and I did 
Surely came back around 


See repercussions (talkin bout the things we do) 
Repercussions (things sure can come back to you) 
Yeah repercussions (what goes around comes around) 
Yeah repercussions (they will get you down) 

Repercussions (talkin bout the things we do) 
Yeah Repercussions (things sure can come back to you) 
Ya need to know that repercussions (what goes around comes around) 
Repercussions (they will get you down)
