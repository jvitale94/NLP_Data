(That cool shit)
Call me conductor, I lead the way for ya
Underground vibe, status self-employed
R A H aka Harriet thug man

Carry out the legacy with seed and husband
Now off with the head tangy watch flip to a genie
And I be a mac like beanie
Out the bottle, I turn thug super model

With rhymes that'll make ya have to settle for movado
The dirtiest getting all the way live
Steady tappin' my shit, tryna eat while I drive
Speeding to a function to play the little actress

Three hours late and don't even know the address
Madness with the I'll sexy flow
And the label spendin' G's not tryin' to let me go
Rockin' on the stage after me, you fool 'cause I am so cool

'Cause she's so cool, yeah oh
Money baby can't you see
(Can't you see, can't you see)
She's so cool
And you can't be as fly as she
(Never be as fly as me)

I aim high beat date in December
A million motherfuckers whose face I don't remember
Next to fall with the b-girl ball tight gear little cousins
The store from the mall rockin' hardcore to some R and B shit

Kickin' rhymes for the 'round the way heads that I'm at peace with
Love the ice rock silver as a preference
Taking writers credit so offer a suggestion
So bust dem heads who ain't real wit' it
Who don't want shit in life and can't deal with it

I see you, frontin' like you on my side
Switch sides thanks for the ride bitch
See me on the cover strike a pose
(Say what?)
Just know after that I'm making off with the clothes

Underground rule for real, so whats the haps?
Take it back like kids who fight in playing caps
Or jacks n ball, freestyle off the wall
Tell 'em don't forget the stones when they make the digga dome

Do away with styling you ain't even found yet
Blow the mic out and ain't nothing but a sound check
Writing rhymes like you wish you could
Tight breaking 'em down on behalf of sisterhood
Spittin' every time use my looks as a tool 'cause I am so cool

'Cause she's so cool
Money baby can't you see
(Can't you see, can't you see)
She's so cool
And you can't be as fly as she
(Never be as fly as me)

Cool
Money baby can't you see
(Can't you see, can't you see)
She's so cool
And you can't be as fly as she
(Never be as fly as me)
She's so, so
You can't be as fly as she, oh
