Where's my sisters?
Where's my sisters?
This one's for the brothers
The brothers, the brothers

Said I be rappin' for da ladies
What's up ladies?
But this one's for da brothers
The brothers, the brothers
Yeah, check it out now

Now I'm the baby in the family and I got three siblings
Three older brothers and we trying to make a living
So we hustle and we bubble and we coming up fast
Ain't gon' never be the same since mom and pops past

The oldest one, child prodigy no doubt
Every since he was a kid used to ride a bitch out
All grown up now nice job, nice clout
Nice wife, nice house, tryna take the right route

Treat sis like a queen brother gave me everything
Any time I got in trouble he could probably pull some strings
Walk daddy's footsteps and career same speed
Made the greatest big brother and a father to his own seed

(Uh, oh)
But something happened on the job, he started snappin'
Problems with the wife, winging out and started cappin'
Tried to turn himself in just to make things right
Ended up taking flight 'cause he's not the jail type

The lesson of today
You have to listen to each and every single word I have to say
Because, Rah Digga remains raw
(Follow the rules, ya hear me, uh?)

Now I got a second brother me and this one was closer
Made me a little tom boy like he was supposed to
Tearing up the place blowing weed in my face
Irresponsible to death parents stayed on his case

Probably 'cause he wanted to be the baby in the family
Drinking with his friends, making up
Mommy carried me, look half way crook getting crazy on the mic
Wasn't really into rap but the shit sound tight

He used to tell me all the time don't wet none sis
By this time next year we gon' be dumb rich
That's when I heard the ill my physical got killed
Just a couple of weeks after signing a record deal

Now somebody gots to bust and have to get a little tough
And on the block round the clock niggas ain't seen nothing
Yeah right, never seen a brother more determined or eager
Moms and pops couldn't see it now we not gonna see it either

Now my last and final brother, kinda something out the norm
Some say part depressed some say part deformed
Record unclean since his early teens
In and out the youth house playing all the crime scenes

Early hangin' with fiends smoking all types of things
He used to chase a basketball now he chasing pipe dreams
From the door, shit was wrong undetected too long
Bugged out when he was little now he big that was wrong

Little too early had to kick him out the house
He just wanted some attention that's what dad was all about
He used to bust down the door moms cry, pops fight
Even family counseling couldn't make this shit right

Word on the street every body wanna do him
From his so called boys to all the chickens he was screwin'
Anybody get the chance, who will probably unload?
How much longer sis got before the last brother gone
Oh no
