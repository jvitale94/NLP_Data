(I know you gotta go home soon, but)
I know you have to go home to him (time just flies everytime I get with you)


Yo, boo, I want you to say, fall back
Put your slippers on, have a seat, give me your leg
I got the baby oil warmed up, Dreamgirls DVD
Stagger Lee swine, could you stay mine, pretty please?
I"m begging you, girl, but time fly since 2 o'clock, boom
I turn around it's like 12 on the dot
What am I to do? Your steeze got a live nigga wanting you
Around the way girl, that's why I don't mind sporting you
