


Unable to become immortalized in life
Ghostface became immortalized in death
Creating a mayhem so vast
That the tale of his rampage would be passed down for generations
Gangsters told their children to never double cross a man
Whose will is so strong
That he could cross the planes of existence to get his revenge
And there you have it
The story of the Ghostface Killah
