


I formed a crew, niggas straight tell me I'm slippin'
I'm the boss of the fam, I need to watch my position
Bitches are sneaky, triflin', and not to be trusted
A weak link in the team, in the chain of combustion
Don't trust her, love is for suckas
Too many enemies is out there son, tryin' to bring the ruckus
Keep a tight circle, don't let her rain on your parade
Keep doin' what we're doin', gettin' money and gettin' paid


Enemies all around me
One mistake and they'll down me
They just wanna rain on my parade
I said the enemies all around you
One mistake and they'll down you
They just wanna rain on your parade


It's mind-boggling the heart wants it, the mind rejects it
Fuck the past, let's put the present in perspective
That's my lady, she would never back-stab or cross me
Stand butt-naked in the storm, sippin' the frosty
Force me to choose, I'mma follow my heart
She was there from the beginning, but I tore 'em apart
No more Delucas, straight Killa Bee on the swarm
And when it's time to get big, she put her game face on
