U know them nights when you looking good 
When it all come together sexy head to toe like you know you should 
Body banging got they tongues hanging 
Got em lined up wanting your atttention 
But you like to keep em waiting 
Riding through they screaming sexy 
But you keep it movin constantly smiling at em come and get me 
Alot of dudes ain't got the courage 
So till they get it up live it up mami that don't keep you worried 
Attention something that you get 
Not something that you need 
Unless you spot the dude that makes you weak (then) 
If that's the case gotta let it flow 
Get close to em let em in yo ear this is what you hear 


All I want is you only you 
You're my fantasy 
Girl you know that I wanna do things to you 
Nobody else gets to do 
U Only you you're my fantasy 
Girl you know that I wanna make it come true 
I wanna make it come true 


Yuh My body your body touching and sweating 
Kissing and tugging 
I swear it get's no better than the tugging 
Love it when it's perfect tell me what you want 
Eyes met mine and it was on 
Wanted to take me home 
Told me that you wanna make me moan 
I was up for it already 
Just to let you take charge 
I was feeling kinda freaky 
And im knowing you the cause 
Told me just to lay back 
Relax close my eyes it'll be alright 
Know im feeling that 
Guess I was yo plan for the night 
Guess wat ima let you be my man for the night 


All I want is you only you 
You're my fantasy 
Girl you know that I wanna do things to you 
Nobody else gets to do 
U Only you you're my fantasy 
Girl you know that I wanna make it come true 
I wanna make it come true
