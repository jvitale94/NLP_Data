The name is Big Daddy you know as in your father
You read the book of Mack and now it's time to meet the author

Ain't no fallin' [Incomprehensible] the mic
Get the bite words to follow like iceberg and babble
I follow the rules of engagement
That I learned from the school in the basement
When I move on the pavement

Cats don't understand what they facin'
Stay patient, update ya game like Playstation
You still sorry, represent ya skills poorly
Vigorous pain that you about to feel shortly

Cats I kill softly, gets bless, spills of me
Get more bucks than Milwaukee keep it real for me
I know the vision and the spot in the light
Took a swing at the God, and all you got was a strike

All you haters in the game you get blocked of the light
But you couldn't see the Kane with a binocular mic, who want it?

Hip-hop icon keep a grip just like a python
The name Kane is superior to anyone
Hip-hop icon keep a grip just like a python
It means Kane Aziatic nobody's equal

Hip-hop icon keep a grip just like a python
The name Kane is superior to anyone
Hip-hop icon keep a grip just like a python
