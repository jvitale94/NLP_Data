Big Daddy Kane
Prince Of Darkness
T.l.c.
[kane]
Question.. what has he done, for you lately?
Tell me.. do y'all go for walks on the beach?
I just wanna know, if you had dinner at the pond
Or the drive-through at mickey d's
You say the last movie y'all saw was _jaws_?  mmm
Well never fear baby, the big daddy is here

I come up upon the scene to romance thee
With a little bit of t.l.c. to tickle your fancy
Give you protection, warmth and affection
Make sure you never feel any rejection
Without a doubt, i admire you, i have a desire to
Be a more better man prior to
Your past relationships, you've been datin
With all the wrong gentlemen, i'm more sentimental
In my own little way so (hey!)
Whattaya say about givin a play okay?
Cause i'm not here to impress you, i wanna caress you
Posess you and bless you, nevertheless
To make you feel secure, and real sure
Mon cheri amore, pretty woman i adore
Don't shed a tear never fear my dear i'll be there
Anywhere with some tender lovin care

Chorus: repeat 2x

Just a little bit of t.l.c.
Tender lovin care you'll get from me
Just a little bit of t.l.c.
Tender lovin care is what you need

In the beginning i only wanted to be your friend
But then..
It may sound strange, but my feelings started to change
And now i wanna sustain..
Somethin more closer, give you the most of my love
And my time and respect as opposed to
Sayin she's "just a friend"
I may sound like biz, but you know what time it is
I want us to be together and benevolent
With reverance to give you the best relationship there ever been
So consider me as as as as as a-a-as your lover
Damn baby, you make me stutter
But i'm still able to, clearly say to you
Things that i feel *smooch* and kiss your navel too
Givin much t.l.c.
As i make love to you constantly

Chorus

[kane]
May i?
He ever treat you with the
Proper amount of chivalry, would be so, mmmm
Break!

* just the drums for a bit *

Bass!

* bassline comes for a bit *

* music by itself comes in, then.. *

[kane]
I hope to form a special thing that we can cherish
Everlasting, it won't perish
Establish a special thing that's based on love
And trust, in other words, it's all about us
You won't have to ever search for tender lovin care
Cause for you i got it right here
You'll never find none greater
Sincerely yours,
The smooth operator
