We 'bout to crush all competition, ain't no chance for y'all
Lil' Kim and Shanice, we 'bout to dance on y'all
Like a flow in the club, it don't matter where you come from
USA to UK, shake ya bum bum

Sean Paul dime, keep my hair done all the time
Even got a manicurist in the booth while I rhyme
Initials on our jackets like Laverne and Sheryl
Kids rock my Queen Bee logo like a Power Puff Girl

We stay on tour from summer to winter
And we rockin' public schools and day care centers
Uh, united we stand, divided you fall
D flawless necklace look like a disco ball

Whoa, y'all don't really want it with the whole Beehive
We goin' down in history, the illest gangstas alive
Put ya hands on your shoulders, push 'em up, push 'em up
If you feel it in your bones, shake it up, shake it up, come on

Bum chicky, chicky bum, chicky bum, bum
Bum chicky, chicky bum, chicky bum, bum
Bum chicky, chicky bum, chicky bum, bum

Bum chicky, chicky bum, chicky bum, bum
Bum chicky, chicky bum, chicky bum, bum
Bum chicky, chicky bum, bum chicky, chicky bum

Now I know I ain't grown, but that don't stop me from shakin' my anus
See I'm 'bout to blow, I'm soon to be famous
Now me and Lil' Kim on the same track is crazy
Matter fact you can call that amazing

Back to back, shakin' our bum bums
Picture us in the war, back to back shakin' off dum, dums
In Y O, that's where I come from
My talents official, act up, the hounds'll come get you

You can catch me on my toes in them D&G flip-flops
Hopin' outta mommy's new bergundy six drop
What, I can't stop what I do for real
It's like for y'all I just got to prove my skills

Oh, I got a ring filled with all baguettes
Nails done, fresh do, be no regrets
All I ask is that ya'll show respect, wile I do my thing
And shake it up with the coolest Queen, uh

Bum chicky, chicky bum, chicky bum, bum

Jack be nimble, Jack better be quick
It's the Queen and the Princess, Jack ain't spit
Oh, like that news van, there they go again
On NBC to, Nickalodean

Sophisticated bad girls, y'all them mad girls
Y'all them birds everybody done had girls
While dudes sendin' me diamonds and pearl sweaters
They little brothers send me sneakers and love letters

Next to Bill Gates, I'm tryna be runner up
Like the elevater shaft, baby girl is comin' up
It's the ill collaboration from the Brook to the Yonks
No more franks for this ma, now it's lobster and conck

To my kids in the hood, this one's for you
Grown folks and grandmas can shake they bum bum too
So come on, come on, come on, come on with it now, get up, get up
Get up and get down with the get down
