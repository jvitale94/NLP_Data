I come from Bed-Stuy where niggaz either do or they gone die
Gotta keep the Ratchet close by, someone murdered
Nobody seen, nobody heard it just another funeral service
Niggaz will get at you, come through shinin', they yap you
In broad daylight kidnap you best get clap through
Police stay on us like tattoos niggaz only grind 'cause we have to

Money is power, sling crack, weed, and powder
Fiends come through every hour it's all about that dollar
And we no deal with cowards, weak lamb get devoured
By the lion in the concrete jungle, the strong stand and rumble
The weak fold and crumble it's the land of trouble
Brooklyn home of the greatest rappers BIG comes first
Then the queen comes after

Now put your lighters up
(Bed-Stuy)
Put your lighters up
(New York)
Put your lighters up
(D.C.)
Keep putting your lighters up
(Philadelphia)

Put your lighters up
(Detroit)
Put your lighters up
(Chi-town)
Keep putting them lighters up
No matter where you from, put your lighters up

Now, let me give you a walk through, show you what to do
And you don't do, where it's not safe to go to
Them boys approach you, better say quick who you close to
Don't come through  if niggaz don't know you
'Cause people is talking, the streets is watching
The G's is lurking, stash the nine in the garbage

The life of a hustla, the life of a gambler
Dice game, kill more niggaz than cancer
You know who you fuck with, Brooklyn don't run, we run shit
Roll up and just bum rush shit, we don't play that
Out in Bk, not at all, for a pound leave your face on the wall

R.I.P in memory of,  never show thy enemies love
We get it on where we live you better have a pass
When you cross that bridge, welcome to Brooklyn

Put your lighters up
(L.A.)
Put your lighters up
(V.A.)
Put your lighters up
(Texas)
Keep putting your lighters up
(New Orleans)

Put your lighters up
(St. Louis)
Put your lighters up
(A T L)
Keep putting them lighters up
No matter where you from, put your lighters up

Damn, homie I'm so tore
And I don't think I'm ever gone smoke no more
And I don't think I'm ever gone drink no more
But fuck it bartender you can give me one more

(We in the club like)
Damn homie I'm so tore
(Lighting the dutch like)
And I don't think I'm ever gone smoke no more

(Passing the bub like)
And I don't think I'm ever gone smoke no more
(Back at the bar like)
Fuck it bartender you can give me one more

See, BIG done told you, I'm the hottest bitch on the planet
Biggest sex symbol, since Janet there's a Nolte bandit
Laying in the cut like a bandage come through
Fulton St. in the vanquish doing them damage
And if you don't understand it then let me give it to you in Spanish

Soy la senorita mas Linda del barrios y lo es abo tu eres despacio
Still over in Brazil, Sipping Mescotto
You must of forgot though, so Imma' take you back
To the block yo put you on to how we rock yo
Some are boosting 12-year olds prostituting
Hit-men hired for execution, there's no solution

Niggaz still piss in the hallways, fiends get high on em' all day
The youth them bang at the cops off the roof
If you don't know my town is the truth, welcome to Brooklyn

Now put your lighters up
(New Jersey)
Put your lighters up
(Boston)
Put your lighters up
(B-More)
Keep putting your lighters up
(Miami)

Put your lighters up
(Puerto Rico)
Put your lighters up
(Kingston, Jamaica)
Keep putting them lighters up
No matter where you from, put your lighters up

Damn, homie I'm so tore
And I don't think I'm ever gone smoke no more
And I don't think I'm ever gone drink no more
But fuck it bartender you can give me one more

(We in the club like)
Damn homie I'm so tore
(Lighting the dutch like)
And I don't think I'm ever gone smoke no more

(Passing the bub like)
And I don't think I'm ever gone smoke no more
