Lil' Kim headlinin' a show, y'all better line up
And if you're sittin' down get your behind up
She got her own class, y'all better sign up
Now, hit â€~em with some Queen bitch 101, girl

It's Queen B, Sex in the City
Representin' uptop, rope the block with me
Custom Versace dress showin' one titty
In Brooklyn, New York, cryin', "Me a grittyâ€

Men see the video and go lick the TV, slow
I show â€~em things they never seen before
â€~Cause the way I move is so flexible
I'll try anythin', I'm a trisexual

The blindfolds and handcuffs, I be rough
With my thighs wrapped around his head like earmuffs
Doin' freaky weird stuff, talk tough, face down
You stepped into the Queen with a diamond laced crown

The Jewel of the Nile, I'm romancin' the stone
I said, â€½Look bitch, I got your man on the phoneâ€
But you could swing through if you want a peep show
Just bring a hund'ed grand and some [Incomprehensible]

I'm a super freak, I'm super freaky, yeah
You know I own it so give it to me, yeah
I'm Ms. Prada and Chanel, Gucci as hell
Voulez vous coucher with this mademoiselle

I sell sex, high priced, the rap Heidi Fleiss
In Iceberg jeans that ass looks mighty nice
And this is the fabulous life of Kim Jones
I got Chinchilla covers on my flip phones

To match with them furs, baby, got back with them curves
A female matte would make up for my words
Flow, mascara and blush
Take that monkey shit off, you embarrassin' us

Comparison what? Ain't nobody close to me
I'm on top, right where I'm supposed to be
And now, haters all kiss my bikini wax
And if you've seen the facts you know the Queen is back

It's my birthday, so go and get the cake
You can have it, you can eat it, just lick the plate
â€~Cause the taste is great and my panties are edible
Incredible, Natalie Cole, Unforgettable

How are you? Big squirt, little muscle
Keep grindin', I got a non-stop hustle
And don't quit, you can't push without pull
And you know you can't talk when you got your mouth full

Now, put your face in it and just nod your head
Go on, work it on down to my thighs and legs
Put your face in it, no bitch can say, â€½We got the whole blockâ€
But the number one Queen Bee

Put your face in it, men gather around
Laid back, hypnotized, I'm the talk of the town
Put your face in it, get right or get goin'
It gets no realer, fake bitches go home
