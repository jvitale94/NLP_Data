Bit-Bitches all on my jock, they want my dang-a-lang,
Swinging all on my NUTS, like an orangutan,
Ha-half a million dollar car, ha-half a million dollar watch,
No roof on the drop head Phantom, it got karate chopped,
I got a couple black belts, but they all from Louie Louie,
Get her wetter than scuba divers, these fucking groupie groupies,
Swag is through the ceiling, these haters mad as fuck,
Gettin money like Vegas chips Bitch STACK EM UP!

Bitches be cryin fo me they want my autograph
Shawty rollercoaster ridin, Six Flags,
She a fool on that dick (Uh huh)
I will never eat that bitch (Uh Uh)
Cold feelin's, hard dick, no hands got me rich
I'm on my Bricksquad Monopoly shit 
4 hoes in my 2 door
Stuntin with the roof up
Flocka always flexin, mad hoes always textin,
tatted up like I'm Mexican, 
Magnums for protection FLOCKA! 
Meet me at the Western

U-Up on my wish bone, these hoes get split in two,
I don't' want no birds up in my car, I don't drive no chicken coop,
I'll be out in that new Ferrari, I be spilling out champagne
No rocks on the road Luda, bitch they're all on my damn chain,
Gotta keep it moving mami, gotta get that guacamole,
I got that purp and a little bit of gold, like I should run with Kobe,
Like I should shoot the Jay, and smoke a couple too,
Other rappers wanna be my friend, I'm too rich to fuck with youuuuuu!

Bitches all on my jock!
