I've been busy
Well, have you at least thought about what we talked about?
Yea, about livin with you?
Yea, I thought about it
Why are you trippin

Oh you talkin bout that girl from up there up the street, right?
Oh, yea nigga I did
I heard about that bitch, man
Aye, she a trip


I be like, I be like damn she got a way about her
And everybody always got something to say about her
She so fine, she so classy but that bitch mean
Everybody wanna throw a little dirt up on er but that bitch clean
Quit hatin on er, recognize er from a mile away
When she be walkin and it's hard to find the words to say
When she be talkin, disrespect it, pay no never mind
Well she just grill, undressin up, she known to take her time
And go and kill em
Hit the club and make these bitches sweat
Not even tryin
Turnin heads just off her silhouette
And I ain't lyin
I'm a say somebody taught her well
She'd never slip and I think she's out here castin spells
I'm tryna tell you shit


She a trip trip trip trip trip trip trip trip
She a trip trip trip trip trip trip trip trip
That bitch a trip
She a trip trip trip trip trip trip trip trip
That girl a trip

Yea girl like that pussy stay wet
Fuck er, keep er in check
Girl if money have her impressed
She wanna ride with me on jets
She a trip trip trip trip trip trip trip trip
She wanna ride with me on jets
She a trip trip trip trip trip trip trip trip
(I'm tryna tell ya'll like I don't believe er)
She wanna ride with me on jets


No matter what, she always on the grind
It seems she know just what to do to stay up on my mind
She send me pics of her naked pose and like in a magazine
I wanna hit it like a drum whenever she go and shake it like a tambourine
Yea, that percussion and she always got the latest bag
Her shoe game stupid and she never fights and never nags
She a keep it movin, got no time for games, lames
False claims, callin out names
Dames all in the same thing, man
End of discussion, what you thought she'll throw you for a loop
That was expected, you might even let er drive your coupe
She'll never wreck it
She respect the finer things, diamond rings, diamond chains
Down to carry Vera Wang's, get a grip
She a motherfuckin trip


She a trip trip trip trip trip trip trip trip
She a trip trip trip trip trip trip trip trip
That bitch a trip
She a trip trip trip trip trip trip trip trip
That girl a trip
She a trip trip trip trip trip trip trip trip
Yea, that girl a trip


Yea girl like that pussy stay wet
Fuck er, keep er in check
Girl if money have her impressed
She wanna ride with me on jets
She a trip trip trip trip trip trip trip trip
She wanna ride with me on jets
She a trip trip trip trip trip trip trip trip
(Going crazy here, man)
She wanna ride with me on jets


That bitch a trip if I ain't never seen it
I get up in the gut, she be telling to beat it like I fuckin mean it
I can't believe it
Got a nigga thinkin that maybe I done met my match
So I put her in the track and yes in fact you'll catch me spendin stacks
Ball up in sacks and I ain't never been the one to trip
Like what am I doing?
But it's something about the way that she ride that dick
My mind is ruined and she using it to her advantage
She love that I'm grown but I think she got some other victims
I'm not alone
Who woulda thought this bad bitch was out here pimpin?
'Cause a nigga sippin, rippin tags off the latest clothes and bags, she so bad
That she can't go nowhere without a bunch of niggas tryna holler
But she all about that buck and all about that mighty dollar


She a trip trip trip trip trip trip trip trip
She a trip trip trip trip trip trip trip trip
That bitch a trip
She a trip trip trip trip trip trip trip trip
That girl a trip
She a trip trip trip trip trip trip trip trip
Yea, that girl a trip


Yea girl like that pussy stay wet
Fuck er, keep er in check
Girl if money have her impressed
She wanna ride with me on jets
She a trip trip trip trip trip trip trip trip
She wanna ride with me on jets
She a trip trip trip trip trip trip trip trip
She wanna ride with me on jets
