

Some days I think I love my whip more than I love my bitch
Everytime we argue I just hop up in my car and split
And my car never talked back to me
It just turned up and played this track to me
And my girl getting jealous trying to wild on her
Calling her used cuz I actually got so many miles on her
And try to make her feel inferior
Since I'm rubbing on my Acura's interior
Whenever I'm with either of my ladies I just love her
See cuz one rides me while I ride in the other mane
I'm bout to go get in trouble mane
With the one that's like my sidekick the other thinks she my mother mane
And I ain't with that
They both got mean bodies but with this Maserati see how I trip that
Pretty feat with nice painting they both drop the top
And both stressing everythang in the parking lot
Gone
