

Yeah
Anything you wanna do I'm ready to do it, my nigga, just say so
Don't say it on the record with your chest, leave the booth and then go lay low
Hiding behind your security detail, actin' like a female
I done sold over 20 million records I could really give a fuck about retail
Now back to basics
Back to Adidas with the fat laces
Back to the Ac' where I'm riding to the track in the track, get it straight nigga, no chases
Age ain't nothing but a number, Luda rapping like he just turned 24
Any rapper wanna forget who I am every now and then I see I gotta let em know
Yo must I remind you
You rap like something behind you
Got paid, but your heart pump Kool Aid
Cover Girl make up should have signed you
But it's never too late
15 years, nigga, never too great
4 years off getting Hollywood checks, but you niggas want beef and you looking like steak

I see that liquor got you loose
When you see me, nigga, say it like you said it in the booth
I'll make you niggas lose a tooth
When you see me, nigga, say it like you said it in the booth
Fuck y'all niggas, I'm the truth
When you see me, nigga, say it like you said it in the booth
Now I'm like, fuck calling a truce
When you see me, nigga, say it like you said it in the booth

Hol' up
Never fuck with a nigga who got some kids
Cause when you talk about me, then you talk about them
Then I gotta come where you live
You takin' food out they mouth, now I gotta put a fist in yours
I don't play about my hustle
A nigga got all these acres
All my neighbors think I'm flipping them birds
Naw, but I be flipping these words
Anything you hear me saying I could back up
And you talk so tough on the mic
But whenever you in sight, nigga, something don't add up
Put your money where your mouth is
Wait, put a gat where your blouse is
You think it's funny cus it's sunny where your house is
Bitch, I'll put my muddy ass boots where your couch is (Fuck yo couch)
I live this shit, you know you do this just for show, nigga
You act as if Ludacris just came and took your ho, nigga
You's a ho, nigga, yeah I said it twice
Let this be warning number two, motherfucker go and roll the dice

I see that liquor got you loose
When you see me, nigga, say it like you said it in the booth
I'll make you niggas lose a tooth
When you see me, nigga, say it like you said it in the booth
Fuck y'all niggas, I'm the truth
When you see me, nigga, say it like you said it in the booth
Now I'm like, fuck calling a truce
When you see me, nigga, say it like you said it in the booth
