

 Refugee camp, with Cypress Hill
 Yo, bringin it on
 Cubans meet the Haitians
Perfect combination, check it



 You say guns
 I say pistolas
 Well if you got beef son
 Callate la boca
 Go meet me on the island where the Cubans meet the Haitians
 A bullet beats the verbal lyrical assassination
 From L.A. to Brooklyn why you doin all that talkin
 Think you got a soul but you're a Dead Man Walking
 Yo toast the host from coasts' we boast
When we meet again, I will be Casper that Friendly Ghost
 You'll hear shots, like the show Cops
Things are still the same, I'm still growin crops
 Wyclef with B-Real, let me build better yet
 Killa bee kill
 Yo B-Real watch your grip



 Hi, boom biddy bye bye
 Ahhhahhh, ahhhahhh
 You open up your eyes you'll be the next one to die
 Ahhahhhh, ahhhahhh
 Boom biddy bye bye
 Ahhahhhh, ahhhahhh
 Ohh as simple as they come as as simple as they die
 Ahhahhhh, ahhhahhh
 Boom biddy bye bye
 Ahhahhhh, ahhhahhh
 Yo who told the boyy, to pack a forty-five
 Ahhahhhh, ahhhahhh
 Boom biddy bye bye
 Ahhahhhh, ahhahhhh
 Now he rest in the place that they call paradise



Fools run up, but they've never seen the last
Spread your last lyrics get broken like glass
Can he pass or does he posess the will
Or does he need to create to keep him straight on the real
Punks are broken some dey fall off the ledge
Refugee Camp bringin it straight over the edge

You duck as I fluff the feathers from ya skin
How ya gonna win that's like Satan without no sin (without no sin)
They'll never happen while I'm rappin I be watchin
The Philistines, creepin up in Manhattan
The sun turn up though Wyclef produce a track with Muggs
But there's no survivors, they all died in the flood





Yo, once a child, twice a villain
If this was drugs I'd make a million off this combination
They say you'redope Clef you're dope so they offer me sess and beer
Beware, you pull your wallet Mr. Thief stares
The opposite direction of the room, he pulled his gun and said
I'm doomed join the son of man in the tomb

I see the soldiers, comin from out the shadows
Ready for battle, ain't trying to hear the baffled
Warriors lined up in full war gear
In it to win it if it goes on for years
Dedicated to the stable of the Assassins
Revolutionaries, just bring on the action




Soldier man
Rewind selector soldier man
Refugee soldier man
Brooklyn soldier man
L.A massive soldier man
New Jersey massive soldier man
Uptown massive soldier man
Long beach massive soldier man
You know the whole world watches soldier man

Boom biddy bye bye open up ya eyes you'll be the next one to die.......
