Lay it better they misunderstood
They misunderstood


Now imagine that there's a shorty
Maybe fatherless or optionless
Grinding from checks depositing
Trying to get on public housing list
Mother meets a man with ample amount of funds
But in order to get that she's gotta give 'em some
So he treats her like a beats her so he cleans her up to keeps her
Like a scream in your in zits her
Like a bitch well
You wonder how she got the whole idea
Her ear to the wall she could hear him pretty clear
Oh you make me mad bitch shut up or get slapped bitch
Roll over or stand bitch who's a fucking man bitch
See what I'm saying is the bed you make you lay in
But what you put out well it kinda remains the same
Well you might not be believing what you hear
But the objects they tend to mirror be closer than they appear so
To sit instead she learned it from her mother
But imagine how it all affected her little brother


Bitch bad, woman good
Lay it better they misunderstood
They misunderstood
I'm killing these bitches
Bitch bad, woman good
Lay it better they misunderstood
They misunderstood
They misunderstood


Now imagine how little brothers maybe 9 or 10
They have no idea exactly what's relaying on his end
Until one day he's out and probably playing with his friends
And to beat and treat a woman like a bitch is what he pretends
We thought that his sister would be the peon in all his drama
But mixed with misconceptions it's hatred for his mama
He grows up to hate the weakness in a woman
Thinks that if he beats her it will potentially make her stronger
Ah the plot thickens
Little boy in by stand gets infected with a sickness
See he grew up wishing his father would come and fix it
With his mama awaiting she'll abuse meant power
But the abuse to put his fist in all the little boys dreams
Till he shifted it and mixed with shit and
To be what he hated wasn't the aim
But his hatred really made him exactly what he became


Bitch bad, woman good
Lay it better they misunderstood
They misunderstood
I'm killing these bitches
Bitch bad, woman good
Lay it better they misunderstood
They misunderstood
They misunderstood


Ok bitch was just a weapon I'm using it to suggest that
The primary example is usually the parents see
Mama didn't stand up 'cause mama couldn't lift her chin up
With all the shame she carried she figured they won't forgive her see
Mama didn't notice that the baby wasn't old enough
She couldn't really show em that there's nowhere left to go but up
All mama had to do is look and listen
Mama as afraid as both of her little children
So she let 'em hear it, let 'em see it
Let 'em grow up let 'em be it
When all she had to do was just show up and help 'em beat it
Now as they grew up in the world
The little boy's lost and has him a little girl
And his life chaning in hurt again he don't ever wanna see hurt by men
To protect her from everything on earth if he can
And that moment he understand
Women should never be hurt by words or hands
And just like that that little boy becomes a man


Bitch bad, woman good
Lay it better they misunderstood
They misunderstood
I'm killing these bitches
Bitch bad, woman good
Lay it better they misunderstood
They misunderstood
They misunderstood
