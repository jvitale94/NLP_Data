Born rotten and exposed
The rose in a garden full of hoes
A flowerbed of souls
Where the flowers never learn
They can go, they can grow, they can
They can be something
I’m a bird, I’m a bird, look at me frontin’
Be confused and obtused, gotta mean some
I don’t feel, I don’t feel, I don’t mean nothing

Mama looking around, what you gotta say
You probably never gave a fuck about me anyway
I know I’m foolish cause I love you with my whole soul
But I keep running so I ain’t gotta to go home, I don’t wanna go home
Running from the fire and my brain’s in my ozone
Running from the pressure ‘til I cave in my own home
You don’t understand the obsessions that I got
I need love, I don’t feel that shit a lot, nigga

Been alone from the motherfucking jump, man
Every battle, every hurdle, every hump, man
Bitches like to feel it or they motherfucking don’t, man
Tell em draw a line and do the motherfucking shhh
Man, listen, I don’t talk about myself, oh no
You don’t get it, you don’t feel it, nigga, oh no
Where I’m from is a nightmare not a smoke show
Niggas never make it there, they never make it, oh no, nigga it’s up

I’m from the generation that is scarred and abused
For real, man
You’re either dead or you’re dying or you doomed
And what’s worse is nobody’s got a clue
Of what the fuck that I go through in my brain
That there’s a fucking beast off the motherfucking chain
That I’ve been having dragons and my heart be in flames
Til I’m broken and too vulnerable again
Love, nobody ever showed me what it was, my nigga, for real
I’ve been beggin' since a youngin', since a cub, my nigga, for real
Saw into your pretty blue soul like the rainbow
A third eye, saw your devil in your angel
We tried to love each other from a different angle
Unfortunately, we still got strangled

I don’t even know if "I'ma make it to the next day"
Every day I wake up and it feels like it’s my death day
You can see inside me like a motherfucking x-ray
Losing to my demons in a motherfucking chest game
It’s a hard life, I choose to lead the memories so lucidly and
I’m just speaking truthfully, it’s hard to breathe, it’s hard to breathe
Damn
