

See I remember the angles
That made your shape in my bed
Didn't think we'd run out of time
So many things I regret
See you and I were like castles
Burning in sun at the beach
Before the tides wash us up
So many things we could be

All I've ever known is how to run
But all you've ever ask me for was love
I've tried to keep my heart away from you
Didn't want to see your heart break in two


And I fall hard
When you love, sometimes you lose
When your love, sometimes it bruises
Now I live on my knees for you
Now my heart is bleeding you, you, you, you

So far gone
I don't even know your name
If I killed your heart
Know that I take all the blame
And I don't wanna fall in love again
I don't wanna fall in love

Oh, baby, stay where you are
You'd never get away if I ain't chase you  this far
It was you and me forever, I remember
You and me forever, God forgive us
But I don't think the blame can be all my fault
Cause you played every game you could name with my heart
You and me forever, has an ending
You and me forever, now I get it

All I've ever known is how to run
But all you've ever ask me for was love
I'm trying to give my heart away from you
Didn't want to see your heart break in two


And I fall hard
When you love, sometimes you lose
When your love, sometimes it bruises
Now I live on my knees for you
Now my heart is bleeding you, you, you, you

So far gone
I don't even know your name
If I killed your heart
Know that I take all the blame
And I don't wanna fall in love again
I don't wanna fall in love

Oh these days are dark, these days are dark, these days are dark
But you'll be in my heart, you're in my heart, you're in my art
All these days are hard, these days are hard, these days are hard
But you'll be in my heart, you're in my heart, you're in my art
All these days are dark, these days are hard, these days are hard
We all have a change of heart, have a change of heart, have a change of heart
All these days are hard, these days are dark, these days are dark
But you'll be in my heart
