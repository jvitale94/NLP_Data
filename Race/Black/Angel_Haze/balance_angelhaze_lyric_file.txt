Ironic I'm tryin' to come in first if it's the last thing
They try to throw me off but I won't let 'em pass me
They kill me with the hating but I ain't in the casket
I got to stay on top, y'all don't fucking over come shit
I had to learn to beat it like I just got a drum kit
Now my motto, keep faith stay strong
Reprover is stay positive and fuck anyone that say opposite
'Cause everybody don't wanna see you win
In the end your biggest enemy is maybe your friend
Keep losing my balance that's the prize of winners song
Tryina' to find God in the eyes of a sinner
'Cause me I'm like the victim through the eyes of a killer
Guns aimed out of worth in the pride that's what been on
I'm the up prize in the lives of demise and devastation
A low peace of heaven left in Satan, surreal


So what if it hurts, the struggle is first
To live is to die we all suffer the curse
And love is the cure until we suffering worse
Pleasure is pain, the suffering's first


Twisted out of my life, my friends said that I changed
But how the fuck you make a difference and still stay the same
They don't carry the weight, they can't handle the pressure
So they can see me involved but they keep catching my essence
My life is insane but I don't get enough credit
But the picture ain't realistic life a photoshop edit
How could you even be mad that I was wanted enhanced
Say I just to hide an option like empty advance
Tap, so fuck 'em all they rather see me fail
I hit the main stream and my ship gone sail
And niggas gon' hate and some gon' plug me
But I remain a problem that nobody resolve it
And I got this acke in my soul and it's distant now
'Cause I'm hotter than the flames on a piston now
I keep losing my balance that's what trips me out
Keep my emotions inside 'til I'm flipping out
But I won't trip, I stand tall just keep my head and hold on
I said I won't trip, I stand tall just keep my head and hold on


So what if it hurts, the struggle is first
To live is to die we all suffer the curse
And love is the cure until we suffering worse
Pleasure is pain, the suffering's first


Sometimes I feel like I'm bound to be a sellout
So I spit fire to try to let this hell out, to try to let myself out
This cage I trapped myself in, but I won't let myself in
I feel like if I'm beside of me I won't let myself win
And I won't let myself in and I'll be damned if I do
I enjoy being myself, I'd be damned if I'm you
See I give them what they nedded and that's the real shit
And I do it with my heart so they can feel this
That's why the words in my songs read broken bonds
Make 'em strong show 'em they got more to focus on
And music is the only thing I put my hope in
Use words to capture my mute emotions
I'm like an umbrella top high I'm hit with a brain
But I walk when it hurts like the ligaments break
And my thoughts like a frame to the picture I paint
I get high off the green like the top of Touraine
They can't extinguish the flames from my mouth when I speak
I got beauty and peace like a tropical beach
And I got me some dreams that I won't stop 'til I reach
And Dr. Kings bitch in the mouth of a freak


So what if it hurts, the struggle is first
To live is to die we all suffer the curse
And love is the cure until we suffering worse
Pleasure is pain, the suffering's first
