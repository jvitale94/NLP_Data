Oh I know that love glows I know that love glows yeah
If we colored our white walls pitch black
Turn all the lights off and lay back
We can make love with our bare hands
We can make light out of thin air
Or we can close our eyes and sleep well
But dreams feel realer than right now
But whatever you do don't let go
My only nightmare is waking up alone
In a world when you're not mine
And the room painted off white
Running out in the daylight, tryna get back to you
When I stare into your eyes, I see my real life
That's why I never sleep with my back to you

When I lay down, facing you
I can feel my eyelids glow (I never sleep with my back to you)
And if the sun rises, (back to you) behind you
I don't think I'd notice though
I never sleep with my back to you, back to you
I never sleep with my back to you, back to you, back to you

Laying under the covers that I stole
From your side of the bed cause I got cold
You rolled over and whispered ro-robbery
So you been sleeping with a thief in your bed
Stole your heart, and your pillows
Whatever you do just don't go
Baby, the worst jail is waking up
Alone in the world when your not mine
In a room painted off white
Running out in the daylight, tryna get back to you
When I'm looking in your eyes, I see my real life
So I never sleep with my back to you

When I lay down, facing you
I can feel my eyelids glow (I never sleep with my back to you)
And if the sun rises (back to you) behind you
I don't think I'd notice though (I never sleep with my back to you)

Like a nightlight, like a teddy bear
Like a toddlers blanket
Look at us baby, two grownups acting like children

Oh oh oh, yeah yeah

When I lay down, facing you
I can feel my eyelids glow (I never sleep with my back to you)
And if the sun rises, (back to you) behind you
I don't think I'd notice though (I never sleep with my back to you, back to you)
When I lay it down, facing you
I can feel my eyelids glow (I never sleep with my back to you)
And if the sun rises, (back to you) behind you
I don't think I'd notice though (I never sleep with my back to you, back to you)
