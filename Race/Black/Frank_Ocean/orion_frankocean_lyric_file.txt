I though that I was
I wanted to conquer the word
Before I could drive

I remember when you were born
Oh, how happy I was
Cause if it didn't go as I planned it
At least you'd double my chances

And it's no pressure, man
Cause you're special
I know you wanna get big and strong quick
But don't skip one second (Orion)

If I could buy back the years
O-O-Orion
I would empty my pockets here (On everything)
O-Orion
Make my regrets disappear
O-O-Orion
Boy I'm jealous of you wilin' there
But promise big bro one thing
That you won't go wasting time
(O) Won't go wasting time
(No) That you won't go wasting time
(O) Won't go wasting time
(No) Don't go wasting it

You gotta know you hit the lotto (lotto)
Cause they don't make em like mamma no more
Hug her and tell her that you love her
That's good time spent

And when you're outside running
It's OK to ask where you're going
So that you're never back where you started
Wondering where time went

And it's no pressure, man
Cause you're special
I know you wanna get big and strong quick
But don't skip one second (Orion)

If I could buy back the years
O-O-Orion
I would empty my pockets here (On everything)
O-Orion
Make my regrets disappear
O-O-Orion
Boy I'm jealous of you wilin' there
But promise big bro one thing
That you won't go wasting time
O-O-Orion
I would empty my pockets here (On everything)
O-Orion
To make my regrets disappear
O-O-Orion
Boy I'm jealous of you wilin' there
But promise big bro one thing
That you won't go wasting time
(O) Won't go wasting time
(No) That you won't go wasting time
(O) Won't go wasting time
(No) Don't go wasting it
