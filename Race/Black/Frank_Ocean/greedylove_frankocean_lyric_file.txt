Got everybody complimenting you
You love attention from the big crowd

Feels like I'm on the sidelines
Right next to suckah and I am the buster girl
Who’s this other guy thats sending you these flowers
Oh now you tell me your ex is your best friend.

Call me crazy
But all I want is you to myself
To share with NO ONE
You can call it jealous but I call it my greedy love.

Greedy loveee 
Oh myyy greedy love

The smile on your face when you got that text late at night wasn’t cause of me
Who else could it be?
And why when your with your friends it’s always movie night or girl’s night

Feels like I'm ridin the bench
Right next to suckah and I am the buster girl
On the dance floor you’re showing off your best moves
You see my blown fuse cause everybody’s on you

Call me crazy
But all I want is you to myself
To share with NO ONE
You can call it jealous but I call it my greedy love.

Greedy loveee 
Oh myyy greedy love

Greedy loveee 
Oh myyy greedy love

The only thing I wish is all that’s in your heart
Tho it seems like I’m nagging ohhhh
Is wanting only me too much to ask
When all I want is you to myself
To share with NO ONE
You can call it jealous but I call it my greedy love.

Greedy loveee 
Oh myyy greedy love

Greedy loveee 
Oh myyy greedy love
