Ohh (Every touch, every kiss, static baby)

Baby, I don't really know which way to go
It's like your energy keep callin'
I, I'm bout to lose my self composure
Even sex has got me braggin'
And you, you look so good
I wish you would give me what I'm looking for
Touch is so electric
Got my heart racing, pulse is off the charts
And I can't even front, I'll be there 1 on 1
And you're the one I want girl

You're like static
The way you put it on me girl, it's like magic
Got me feenin' for your touch like an addict, gotta have it
Girl this thing feels so good, so I wish you would
You're like static, static, static
Girl you're like static, static, static
Girl this thing feels so good, so I wish you would

And I ain't even playing girl
There's so much truth in what I'm saying girl
You got my head all in it, like a game of chess baby check mate
This ain't no first date, don't hesitate, no
And I'm a take it nice and slow, yeah.
Take your body where it needs to go
Give me what I'm looking for, touch is so electric
Got my heart racing, pulse is off the charts
And I can't even front, I need the 1 on 1
You're the one I want, girl

You're like static
The way you put it on me girl, it's like magic
Got me feenin' for your touch like an addict, gotta have it
Girl this thing feels so good, so I wish you would
You're like static, static, static
Girl you're like static, static, static
Girl this thing feels so good, so I wish you would

Doin' 85 on a freeway, switchin' lanes in my Range
GPS is saying next exit, I got your text message
I'm on my way to you, here's what were gonna do
And girl I tell you to, move in closer, don't stop
Don't mess up the flow, don't be scared
Touch right there, make it personal
I don't really know what it is that you do
It's like a force, I'm stuck onto you like static

You're like static
The way you put it on me girl, it's like magic
Got me feenin' for your touch like an addict, gotta have it
Girl this thing feels so good, so I wish you would
You're like static, static, static
Girl you're like static, static, static
Girl this thing feels so good, so I wish you would
