Got up in the car, Creeped in the steel, Please give me mine
Tree's give em' back, Give me tourists, Give me traffic
Give me noise, Just give it back
Could you bring back all my police, Give me order
Turn back on my lights, Give me fuel and water
I think I'm begging, cause' now that everything's gone
I'm needing mine, I'm needing mine

With the streets all dark, It looks like my building's are gone
I made you the mayor of my town honey
And I'm why you are the senate representative
I gave you the key to my city, Gave you, Power over, Power over me
Give it to me, Give it back to me, The city belongs to me
The city is ours no more

Tell the government, Please give me funding
Can't you see that I'm doing bad?
Give me floodgates, Give me Levy's
Too much water can you push it back
How you just gon' leave me out of of order
I ain't got no lights and no fuel to start up
I know I'm begging, cause' now that everything's dried up
I'm needing mine, I'm needing mine

And with the streets all dark, The buildings look lost
I made you the mayor of my town honey
I'm why you are the senate representative
I gave you the key to my city, All power over, power over me
Give it to me, Give it back to me, The city belongs to me
The city is ours no more

We used to be sky high
We used to be major
We used to be sky high
We used to be major, baby, major

Give it to me, Give it back to me
The city mine baby, This whole city is mine, The city is mine honey
Give it to me, Give it back to me
The city is mine oh baby, The city is mine, The city is mine
