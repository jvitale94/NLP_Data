

These hands that I pray with
For just one more chance
Also took off the dress of that woman
I'm a simple man, got some simple problems
Are simple, simple mistake
Simply made it so hard for you to love me


It's simply hard but I gotta get back to ur love
Im simply wrong, but I still wanna hold ya
Its simply hard, so hard
Simply hard but I gotta get back to ur love, ur love

My mother say son dont break her heart
And staying in love won't be so hard
Its simple

Say I love you I do, I do
And meant it, like its over over over and over
Simple man, couple simple problems
One simple, simple mistake
Simply made it so hard fo you to love me


Its simply hard but I gotta get back to ur love
Im simply wrong, but I still wanna hold ya
Its simply hard, so hard
Simply hard but I gotta get back to ur love, ur love

I wish I could simply say im sorry, baby ooooh
I wish you say you simply can't fall out of love love with me
Then maybe we could move one (cause I really can't)
Move on (I gotta) get on with our hearts
With ours lifes cause its simply to short
Without love
