

Sitting next to your coffee table
I'm trying to fix your cable box, again
Said you couldn't get channel 4
And that's the only one you wanted to watch

Last week I was walking your dog, baby
Scrubbing your dishes
Took your clothes to the cleaners
I don't mind, cause


When I'm done
When I'm done
I'm gonna get every little bit of your love
When I'm done (I'm gonna get it)
When I'm done (You're gonna get it)
You gonna feel every little bit of my love

Spend all day in my kitchen  slaving
Didn't even know that I could cook
But you say you're tired and you're ready to go oh-oh
Girl you didn't even touch your food

Last week I was washing your towels
Scrubbing your dishes
Took your clothes to the cleaners
I don't mind, cause



Well, gimme some more baby
Gimme some more
It's never enough baby
You gotta let me know
You need something, tell me something, gather something to hold
Baby I'll do it
