I crossed my heart and hope to die
I will never let them cry

I held you in my arms
Said I wont let go until you feel you’re ready (Til you feel you’re ready)

Told me on the phone
Something bout you love me
Ooh baby say it to my face
I can have a place in your world
Kinda like your Army, your Air Force, your Peace Core


So baby Follow Follow Follow
Tell me where you want to go
Just keep your boddy close and don't let go
Follow Follow Follow

Baby let me be the guide
just listen for the signs
And when I tell you Right, Left, Switch it up
I'ma take it Slow, I'ma take it slow (Ooh)

Oh baby stop there, right there
Don't lose control, don't lose control (Ohh)

Now baby look up at the star
If you wanna go, promise we can go (Oh)
You just gotta Follow Follow Follow
You just gotta Follow Follow Follow


Ohh Baby if you like
We can go to Paradise
Be back by the next sunrise

And no, I wont stay in Rome
I never go faster the limit (not unless you with it)

And you told me on the phone
Said you wanna love me
Well baby tell me how it feels

Gotta have place in your world
Something like no other your Lover, your Best Friend, ooh


So baby Follow Follow Follow
Tell me where you want to go
Just keep your body close and dont let go

Baby let me be the guide
just listen for the signs
And when I tell you Right, Left, Switch it up

Now baby look up at the star
