Don’t touch that 
Could you please be still (baby stop)
No baby you can’t have that
Until you eat your dinner
Guess I got to feed you

Like a baby girl
You’re the cutest, you’re the cutest thing
But you can’t always get your way
Like a baby girl
I want to keep that smile on your face, oh boy
But it ain't easy, you don’t make it easy

You’re old enough to drink 
But when it comes to love you think just like
A two year old terror
Twenty Two year old terror
Temper tantrums out of bound
Cause you want it when you want
Like a two year old terror
Twenty Two year old terror

Now you know you should be sleeping but ok
I’ll give you ten more minutes
We’ve been sleeping in the same bed
Cause you been having nightmares
And you need me here, I guess I always treat you 

Like a baby girl
You’re the cutest, you’re the cutest thing, oh yeah
But you can’t always get your way
Like a baby girl
I want to keep that smile on your face, oh ha
But it ain’t easy, no it ain’t easy

You’re old enough to drink 
But when it comes to love you think just like
A two year old terror
Twenty Two year old terror
Temper tantrums out of bound
Cause you want it when you want
Like a two year old terror
Twenty Two year old terror

You’re old enough to drink 
But when it comes to love you think just like
A two year old terror
Twenty Two year old terror
Temper tantrums out of bound
Cause you want it when you want
Like a two year old terror
Twenty Two year old terror

You want love, well no more sugar for you
You don’t know to act, so no more sugar for you
You’re jumping off the walls, no more sugar for you
I said ain’t no sugar for you
Well just a little bit but

You’re old enough to drink 
But when it comes to love you think just like
A two year old terror
Twenty Two year old terror
Temper tantrums out of bound
Cause you want it when you want
Like a two year old terror
Twenty Two year old terror

You’re old enough to drink 
But when it comes to love you think just like
A two year old terror
Twenty Two year old terror
Temper tantrums out of bound
Cause you want it when you want
Like a two year old terror
Twenty Two year old terror
