

Taking turns with pressing ignore
And we both
Come to the conclusion that there's no one we both love more
Back and forth, emotional tug of war
Girl I love you
But I just can't do this revolving door, any longer


I'm motion sick
Oh, oh, from going in circles
What happened, we were close
Where do we go, no
Better yet how do we make it right
This ain't making sense no more


Yeah, so I put my left hand on your waist
Right hand throwing the peace sign
Waving truce, waving truce, waving truce yeah
I put my lips up on your face
White rag up in the sky
I'm waving truce, waving truce, waving truce, truce
I'm calling a truce, truce, calling a truce, truce
Calling a truce, calling a truce

Maybe it's the "me" in you that I dislike the most
Ironically in the beginning that's what made us close
And now that's the very reason
We're slamming doors
But we're both adults, it's time we get over it


I'm motion sick
Oh, oh, from going in circles
What happened, we were close
Where do we go, no
Better yet how do we make it right
This ain't making sense no more


Yeah, so I put my left hand on your waist
Right hand throwing the peace sign
Waving truce, waving truce, waving truce yeah
I put my lips up on your face
White rag up in the sky
I'm waving truce, waving truce, waving truce (truce)
I'm calling a truce (truce) calling a truce (truce)
Calling a truce (truce), calling a truce (truce)

If we stop this fighting
We can dance all night in this bitch
Be no fighting if you keep on rocking that shit
Won't be no fighting, I'm a throw the towel in
Cause I decided, I like us way better like this


Yeah, so I put my left hand on your waist
Right hand throwing the peace sign
Waving truce, waving truce, waving truce yeah
I put my lips up on your face
White rag up in the sky
I'm waving truce, waving truce, waving truce (truce)
I'm calling a truce (truce) calling a truce (truce)
Calling a truce (truce), calling a truce (truce)
