I know I left with these heavy thoughts
They been on my mind oh I
I got cargo with me
All those memories feel
Like a thousand pounds on my
In my bed trying to sleep
The ceiling lowers down
I feel it on me now

I been moving buses further and further
I just can't do this alone
I just can't do it alone
I been pulling airplanes higher and higher
I just can't move them alone
And I just can't move them alone
It's too heavy for me
Overload overload overload
Take over for me
Its too heavy for me
Overload overload but no Superman will save me
But can somebody lend a hand it's too heavy for me
Overload overload overload

Drag my life along by the end of a rope
Trying to make by Im trying
On the other side someone's tuggin hard
They only getting stronger
Balance bricks on shoulders
With the grit in my shoes
I'm not strong enough
Help me up help me out

I been moving buses futher and futher
I just can do this alone
I just can't do it alone
I been pulling airplanes higher and higher
I just can't move them alone
And I just can't move them alone
It's too heavy for me
Overload overload overload take over for me
Its too heavy for me
Overload overload but no Superman will save me
But can somebody lend a hand it's too heavy for me
Overload Overload overload
Take over for me it's too heavy for me
Overload overload but no Superman will save me
But can somebody lend a hand it's too heavy for me

I been tryin to hold up the world with both my hands
Been holding the world in both my hands can't hold up the world
It's coming down it's coming ...

Its too heavy for me
Overload overload overload take over for me
Its too heavy for me
Overload overload but no Superman will save me
But can somebody lend a hand it's too heavy for me
Overload overload overload
Overload overload overload
