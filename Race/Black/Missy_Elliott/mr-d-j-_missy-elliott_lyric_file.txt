It's all about, Lady Saw and Missy
And the next thing is about, the big bashing party
I'm feelin' you Timbaland, I'm feelin' you
Yo, and we wind up when we a listen dis now, check, ay

There's a party
I'm up in the club and I'm drinking I'm drunk off the Alize
As I hear the record spins it seems to take over me
So I move side to side an it's something inside that controls me
As I walk to the D.J. and I say

Mr. D.J., spin it one more time
We gonna play it back to back, we gon' rock it two times
Move your feet with me, move your hands with me
See how easy it's gon' be for you and me, you see

Mr. D.J., spin it one more time
We gonna play it back to back, we gon' rock it two times
Move your feet with me, move your hands with me
See how easy its gon' be for you

You say your a baller
'Cause you up in the club, fakin' like you got dough, with your dollars
To my peoples with me money, let me hear you holler
We're gonna party like no other party, don't stop 'til the morning
But before I go this is what I say

Mr. D.J., spin it one more time
We gonna play it back to back, we gon' rock it two times
Move your feet with me, move your hands with me
See how easy it's gon' be for you and me, you see

Mr. D.J., spin it one more time
We gonna play it back to back, we gon' rock it two times
Move your feet with me, move your hands with me
See how easy its gon' be for you
