oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm really, really
Hot, Hot, Hot, Hot, Hot

[1st VERSE]
Let me holla' at the d.j.
Come on d.j. put that record on the replay
Don't you see how them bitches move they bootay
Everytime you play this record, smell like coochie
Follow dem', Screamin' like a groupay
Misdemeanor move my nookie like a hoochay
For them hatas fuck whatever you say
Because you know I'm too cool for you anyway
I'm just a bad bitch
M-I-S, Miss
I'm gonna' keep talkin' shit till you get this
I'm gonna' bust up in the club wit' no guest list
Them otha' artist, I keep em' all restless
I don't french kiss unless it's 50 cent
Vivica, we can share him like the president
Tabloids, I don't care, it's irrelevant, I'm heaven sent
Now watch how I do this shit

[PRE-HOOK]
[CHORUS]
I'm really, really hot
Everytime my records drop
Radio says I won't stop
Cus' I'm killin' em'

[2nd VERSE]
You don't know whatcha' talkin' bout
You would think I was Sug when I come out
My album hit hard when I roll out
Yall records make a bitch wanna' throw em out
And that's no doubt
See I rock bells
Fly as hell and cool as?
Baby can't ya' tell
I lick my lips like I'm L.L.
And I'm doin' it, and doin' it, and doin' it well
Straight to the hotel
I'm cellabut so, boy, you gets no tell
Kiss, kiss and still you gets nowhere
Just two blue balls down in yo' underwear
I play unfair
I'm a hot gal
Hot cars and stars and strip bars
And ain't hot if I'm not there
I'm a true playa'
You can find me up in any record store
Hurry up and get chere

[PRE-HOOK]
[CHORUS]

Look, let me move to the left
Go head, let me feel myself
Touch my chest my sweat
Show that d.j. how I shake my breast
Jiggle, jiggle, jangle
Watch how my gludius dangle
I do a 1-2 step, STOP
No, I ain't done yet
Everybody in the club, go to work
Tight jeans, crop shirts, short skirts
I'm gonna' rock to the beat till' it hurt
I'm gonna' drop it on the street
Yeah ya' heard
Hatas' I flip the bird
Got guns, so what, I ain't scurred
I came to boogie and swerve
I ain't lyin' folk that's my word

[PRE-HOOK]
[CHORUS]
