I'm talking about love, love, love
All my girls stand in a circle and clap your hands
This is for you
Ups and downs highs and lows NO matter what you see me through
My boyfriend he don't answer on the telephone
I don't even know where the hell he goes
But all my girls we're in a circle and nobody's gonna break through

Girls for life x 2

Oh hold off I need another one
I think you, you do too
Grab my bag, got my own money
Don't need any man in this room
My boyfriend he'll be calling me now anytime
I need all my girls to keep him off my mind
So hold up we need another one
What we got is all good
L, O, L, O, L, O, L, O, V, E
