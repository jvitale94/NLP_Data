Religious Blessings (Outro)
Being caught up in the fame
A part of the glamour and the glitz
Platinum rings and different things
How easy we forget

For it is Him, the Lord Almighty
Who allows us our success
When you on top above the charts
How easy we forget

Do you think without Him
You would be who you are?
For if He made heaven and earth
He also made you a star

So as we reach the year 2000
You know there's One higher than us
And I come to be that tool to tell you
In God we must trust

Love you
