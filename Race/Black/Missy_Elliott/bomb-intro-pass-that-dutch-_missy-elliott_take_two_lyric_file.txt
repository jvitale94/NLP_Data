Listen up everyone
We have just been informed that there's an unknown virus
That's attacking all clubs
Symptoms have been said to be heavy breathing
Wild dancing, coughing
So when you hear the sound whooo
Run for cover muthafucka
Mmm, whoo, ah daddy, whoo, ah, oh, ooh
Pass that dutch, pass that dutch
Pass that dutch, pass that dutch
Pass that dutch, pass that dutch
Pass that dutch, pass that dutch
Misdemeanor on the floor, pretty boy here I come
Pumps in the bunk, make you wanna hurt something
I can take your man, I don't have to sex 'em
Hang him out the window, call me Michael Jackson
I'm a pain in your rectum, I am that bitch y'all slept on
Heavy hitter, rhyme spitter, call me re-run
Hey, hey, hey, I'm what's happening
Hypnotic in my drink, that's right
Shake your ass till it stink, that's right
Mr. Mo's on the beat, that's right
Put it down for the streets, that's right
Pass that dutch, pass that dutch
Pass that dutch, pass that dutch
Pass that dutch, come on pass the dutch baby
Shake, shake, shake your stuff baby
Pass that dutch, pass that dutch
Pass that dutch, pass that dutch
Pop that, pop that, jiggle that fat
Don't stop, get it till your clothes get wet
Number one, drums go bump, bump, bump
This beat here will make you hump, bump, jump
If you's a fat one put your clothes back on
Before you start putting pot holes in my lawn
Oh my God, show my God
Shove 'em under attack like my name was Saddam
I am the bomb from New York to Milan
And I can write a song sicker than Jeffrey Dahm'
Don't touch my car alarm
Break in my car, you will hear viper armed
I've been a superstar since Daddy Kane was raw
I'm live on stage, come on and give me some applause
Thank you, oh thank you
You all are so wonderful
Pass that dutch, pass that dutch
Pass that dutch, pass that dutch
Pass that dutch, come on pass the dutch baby
Shake, shake, shake your stuff baby
Pass that dutch, pass that dutch
Pass that dutch, pass that dutch
Pop that, pop that, jiggle that fat
Don't stop, get it till your clothes get wet
Listen up Muthafuckers
You have 5 seconds to catch your breath
5 4 3 2 1
Pop that, pop that, make that money
Just keep it going like the Energizer bunny
Shake that, shake that, move it all around
Spank that, yank that dutch back now
Freak him, freak her, whatever your choice
Didn't come to judge, I came to get you moist
Scream, now my voice is lost
Can I get a ride on a white horse?
Pass that dutch, pass that dutch
Pass that dutch, pass that dutch
Pass that dutch, come on pass the dutch baby
Shake, shake, shake your stuff baby
Pass that dutch, pass that dutch
Pass that dutch, pass that dutch
Pop that, pop that, jiggle that fat
Don't stop, get it till your clothes get wet
Pop that
Pass the dutch baby
Jiggle that fat
