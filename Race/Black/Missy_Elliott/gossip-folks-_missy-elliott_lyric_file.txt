Yo, yo, move out the way we got Missy Elliot commin' through
Girl that is Missy Elliot, she lost a lot of weight
I heard she eat one cracker a day
Girl, what I heard the bitch was married to Tim
And started fuckin' with Trina
Well I heard the bitch got hit by three zebras and a monkey
I can't stand the bitch no way

When I walk up in the peace
I ain't gotta even speak
Im a bad mamma jamma god damnit muthafucka
You aint gotta like me
I aint sweatin these hoes
Need to talk, what ya know
Stop talking bout who Im stickin im lickin
You just mad it aint yours
I know yall poor
Yall broke
Yall jobs just hangin up coats
Step to me get burnt like toast
Muthafucka adios amigos
Ah ha, pose pose
I don't brag I mostly boast
From the VA to the LA coast

Now I don't go out my house shorty you just waitin to see
Who im roll up in the club with and report that next week
Just wanna see who I am ******* or sniffin some coke
I know by the time I finish this line ima hear this on the radio
Once upon a time in Kyla park
Where they live life fast and they scared of dark
There was a little nigga by the name of 'cris
Nobody paid him any mind
No one gave a shit
Knowing he could rap
No one lend a hand
So he went about his business
And devised the plan
Made a CD then he hit the block
Fifty thousand sold, seven dollars a pop
Hold the phone, three years later
Steped out the swamp with ten and a half gators
Now all around the world on the microphone
He leaves the booth smellin like Burberry cologne
Still ride the chrome
Got bitches in the kitchen
Never home alone
And hes on the grind
Please let me know if hes on your mind
And respect youll gimmie
Ludacris, I live loud like timmy
Had to clear these rumors
I got a headache and its not a tumor
Get up on my lap get my head tucked tight
Sprayed so I never let the bed bugs bite
Im hard to the core
Core to the right
You drop down turn around pick up hella clip (yaaaa)
