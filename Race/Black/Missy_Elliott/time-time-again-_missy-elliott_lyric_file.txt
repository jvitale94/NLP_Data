The things you said to me, can't make or break me
Everything you've bought I give back, absolutely everything
And I am through with you, you and your crazy moods
You be trippin' and slippin' and givin' attitudes

I deserve the finer things, the joy that love brings
And you'll be missin' my kisses' and makin' love, sayin'
I'm better off alone, can't wait 'til you get gone
Ain't no need to keep hoping 'cause it's over and done

Why do you keep coming back time and time again?
You promised me you'd change your ways time and time again
I heard the same ol' lyin from you time and time again
And why I take you back because I cannot change a man

Why do you keep coming back time and time again?
You promised me you'd change your ways time and time again
I heard the same ol' lyin from you time and time again
And why I take you back because I cannot change a man

No use in talkin', better get to walkin'
Better get them chicks who turn tricks 'cause I'm just too smart, man
I hate men who lies, who looks me in my eyes
Come up with alibis for the thousandth time

I won't take bullshit, leave ya ass with the quickness
Because I'm stable and able to live my life alone
Boy, I'm through with you, no more to say or do
'Cause you're too confused and it's over and done

Why do you keep coming back time and time again?
You promised me you'd change your ways time and time again
I heard the same ol' lyin from you time and time again
And why I take you back because I cannot change a man

Why do you keep coming back time and time again?
You promised me you'd change your ways time and time again
I heard the same ol' lyin from you time and time again
And why I take you back because I cannot change a man

I be comin' with a rap on a ballad
You should vote Misdemeanor on your ballots
'Cause you know I blow ya mind anytime that I rhyme
And I be down for a challenge

I'm wicked I-C-K icked and I twist a twisted
From coast to coast I brag and boast, I'm better than most insufficient
I got that good love, that goody goody good love
That poody poody pusha

Slick talkin' sista to any nigga that wanna get with her
Don't ever diss her M dot S E
And let me stop playin' with y'all motha fuckas
This ain't no rap record, get back to the hook

Why do you keep coming back time and time again?
You promised me you'd change your ways time and time again
I heard the same ol' lyin from you time and time again
And why I take you back because I cannot change a man

Why do you keep coming back time and time again?
You promised me you'd change your ways time and time again
I heard the same ol' lyin from you time and time again
And why I take you back because I cannot change a man
