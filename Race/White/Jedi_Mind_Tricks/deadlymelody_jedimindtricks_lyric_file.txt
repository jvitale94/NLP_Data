It's like you're crawlin' into your tomb
Deadliest of melodies, deadliest of melodies
Once the wraths get a hold of your soul
It's like you're trapped and there's no way to go
Deadliest of melodies, deadliest of melodies


I don't have the bot to care
It's off; it's my cross to bear
Lost the cross I use to wear
I am cost to wear
Partnership with darkness, we're an awesome pair
Soul position, wall facin' in office chair
In the depths of hell, death for sale
Where blood propels from the cells
And every EL is extra L
It's hot here; hear the sears from the drop tears
It's an opera to the ears of gospel fears
Hot careers grotesque slow deaths
Here is where I am noblest and over sexed
It's a whole mess of loneliest, no regrets
Unholiness, corrosive mental roll of decks
I know uncertainty, personally, murder uncourtesly, merciless
Soul save haven, open up my swollen heart
The whole greater then the sum of it's broken part




I'm your worst nightmare, tho reversal of Christ here
The only thing you're figurin' is a shadow and knife glare
Me, I ain't the type of mothafucka to fight fam
Pistol grip, pump chainsaw and a pipe here
Y'all are pussy watered down like a light bare
I don't run from it, I embrace it, I like fair
Texas Chainsaw Massacre, I invite fare
Call me leather face, mothafucka I'm right here
Call me any other person that's an evil killer
Pazienza punches pilots - call me Jesus killer
Call me Richard Ramirez because he spilled venom
I'm Mark David Chapman before he killed Lennon
I will study on my lessons when the Earth is seedless
You're like Judas Iscariot when he murdered Jesus
The way my operation works is like a surgeon thesis
I'll drink the period blood of a fuckin' virgin priestess




Maserati Mazi, it's the D E M O Z
Nah homie you can't control me, I pop slowly
Thinkin' you know me, slough
Only niggas is starrin' hard like I'm lookin' familiar
If you don't owe me I ain't lookin' to kill ya
Still the smell's too funny, the plot thickens
A lot of you die snitchin'
Ligament's missin' and illiterate niggas die hissin'
Why would I wanna trade my soul for ya riches
And noose the devil I neva break the rules of the ghetto
From borough to borough I rep the most thoroughest city Philly
The livest, rhymes pay homage, cause I'm a survivor, you lyin'
Demoz, either you love me or hate me
Hug me or snake me, lately I've been behavin' like I ain't got a baby
Maybe it's the way my lady treats me, crazy, shady thoughts
Run thru my head by the minute but still I play my part
Peace to Arie, peace-n-peace
Shit my piece of work is not peace or nothin'
Frontin' if I'm bringin' peace to Earth
