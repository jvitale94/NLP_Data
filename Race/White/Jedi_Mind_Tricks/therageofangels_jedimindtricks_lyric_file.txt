Jedi Mind Tricks
My man Stoup holdin' me down
Yea yea
It's been five years since you've been locked in the pen
And not to mention all the fuckin drama it bring
You always in my heart and that's a beautiful thing
Like warm air flowin from a beautiful spring
But that's sum wild shit to do to a king
And maybe some day I'll get used to the sting
For now I'll been thinkin about you everyday
And how we use to dumb out in everyway
Brought a smile to my face on my hardest of days
And praying that your mother and your father can raise
Your little brother into a man one day
I'll stay in touch with him so the plan won't stray
But don't you worry about your little brother, he fine
He smart with a heart and he steadily shine
And if the little soulja ever step outta line
You know I'm gonna be there to show him the time

So what the deal cuzin how it feel right now
I'll be there soon so just chill right now 

Yea it's Vinnie Paz, you know I'm sayin, Jedi Mind, I'm holdin' you down baby


I'd rather walk these hollow grounds wit a glock or four pounds
Police lookin' over my back with a glock it's low down
With a clock that slows down, it shoots flock with no sound
And I'm carried away on my back like a stone popper party
Lyin' til' my soul hurts (soul hurts)
Mad as fuck scared and stuck, I can't control earth
Surrounded feelin like a cold hearse wanting to fold first
I thank my peeps every day becuz they chose birth
I'm totally greatful, at times I act hateful
Ya'll wish ya'll feed over me to reside in a gold cradle
Brown paper bag living in the latest whips
Trips to Ep Cops Centre in the space and shit
Always reminisce about the shit you laced us with
Always the street legend to the bravest cliques
And now i see niggaz gettin, it makes me sick
The same shit that could've made us rich, made us snitch
Divide the men from the boys see what makes them bitch
To watch mothers lovin' struggles just to raise their kids
Soar my mind every time that I raise this fifth
And drink the bottle til' it's hollow and it all makes sense

Get it right, blood is thicker than water, could never shit on my peeps
Allah space
