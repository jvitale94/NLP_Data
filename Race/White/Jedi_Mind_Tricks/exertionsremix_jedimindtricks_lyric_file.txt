


You get split in fucking half
The Ikon the Hologram wrath
But I am the center inside the placenta of math
You clash with cyanide gas and die fast
Rythmical equivalent of solids, liquids and gas
We smash your science, with the power of Lord Titus
But I am the virus inside of the iris of Cyrus
Upon papyrus
I kill snipers and body vipers
And strangle you with the organs of rioters who try to fight us
Call me your highness
And sip the blood from the phoenix
Who's guilty like the Jews in the crucifixion of Jesus
Murder the heathens
And perish in a pit of cobras
Word is bond, my rhymes form into a swarm of locusts
Provoke us
And face the Zodiac killers
Five Samurai, do or die, fire spitters
Heavy hitters, from the lands of Sudan
Killadel Shambala Ikon the Hologram
What?
  

All religions fear ?Miguel?
My strikes are fatal, to your style
That's infantile like prenatal
Your mic's a child
That's getting fucked by a wild pedophile
????? ?????? ?????? ?????? ????? ???? pectoral
So suck my genitals you punk bitch
I'm the general
Concocting verbs out of chemicals
Leave you bloody like menstrual
Cycle, my rap rifle blasts open any beat you throw
Virtuoso flows like an ocean through an archapelago
  

At a glance yo my battle stance rattles champls like an avalanche
Crabs don't have a chance you sycophants spend your cash advance grabbin a lance try 
to joust with the conqueror
Stompin the pawns that sponsor ya 
Onto the crucifix
I chew ya crew to bits like Mucelix or computer chips 
Who can dis the pugelist?
Rappers tried, and now they calcified up in formaldehyde
Your valves canals divide
I scalp hides my names italicized to chastise replicants of nexus 6's excellence
Present tense malevolence, devastating regiments
Ever since I supplied a diatribe of cyanide you revised whom you idolize
I finalize death threats, you recollect the esoteridactyl
Court is now in session mothafucka drop the gavel


Knowledge is self taught to be defining me spiritual
??????? ??????? ??????? ?????????
Like oracles at Delphi when they're spoken to
Mortals refer to me as ?????? ????? ????
For exposing the secrets of the sands while I'm blessing you
My presence equals principle like a method philosophies
Of reparations, for payment, a stolen legacy
So hail, homie
I make up the pharoah
Like Ma'at i seek truth through the tarot
Choosing the teachings of 'Nezzar over that of the devil
And trading places with ????? ????? to hear my ancestors echo
Commanding thoughts the lady forming the facts
That led me to the holy near the temple of Kanak
