My man Stoupe holdin it down
it's the real raw shit
the hardcore shit, kna-am sayin?

Yea


Friday the thirteen-style slashing ya face
bashing ya face, tell ya army, get back to their base
c'mon cousin, that's how we get down
we the only reason that you eat and breath in this town
we beatin them down
raise a blade, buck 50
I rap like no one out there can fuck with me
stuck with me, we ain't leaving the game
and keep it dirty cause we never had a reason to change
we keep it the same, start a war with the glock nine
and thug like a mob, and rock mine
So let me speak the truth again
the ancient babylonian's with nubian
you need to watch what you read in your class
cause the devil try to have you or repeatin the pass
I'm ready to go to war for Mumia
Fuck George Bush and his war, we gawn see him


Yea, walk with me now
Yea, walk with me now
Tryna step into the zone with Vinnie Paz is a...
understand that I ain't really fuckin around
Yea... Yea, walk with me now
Live raps crack ya jaw (Live raps crack ya jaw)
Yea, walk with me now...


I came down, the shame clown, kickin my same sound
I'ma reign now, giant fist-splitted james brown
I'm the poet, who rhymes was quoted
lines are loaded
shine decoded the vote and flow and showing signs I wrote it
At a auction, B, style cost some g's
Challangers eyes makes tears like they're forced of these
Percee P, that's me I get nasty
rock it flashy, pass me the mic at your ass, G
but I make wrecks, tape decks at my apex
packing latex, and safe sex with chicks and stricken paychecks
killing ya, fillin ya with rhymes similar
to bullets in the cylinder of a dillinger spillin ya brainfat
I'll blast ya later, you be then essays
And be there next day like JFK's assasinator
Nobody, ever win to represent us, never did
why you had to take us, I take every cent and your hottie


Yea, walk with me now
Yea, walk with me now
Tryna step into the zone with Vinnie Paz is a...
understand that I ain't really fuckin around


I'm like a dessert eagle when the hammer is cocked back
Anybody holdin any money should drop that
we shot back, spit a gospel of force
And burn y'll, with my philosophical torch
we're just tryna bring the raw shit
smoke a L, drink a forty on the block, raw shit
the hardcore shit, for ya'll the dumbed out
standin the back of the club and pull the gun out
Everybody run out, the sun out, it's over
I'll take it back to the past like Sankofa


Yea, it's vinnie paz baby. Stoupe - The enemy of mankind
it's like a brotherhood, it's all blood
it's all love baby, it's all love
walk with me now
walk with me now, what's the deal baby?
walk with me now
it's jedi mind, steadily shine
live from the 215, keepin it live... aight? Yea, yea
