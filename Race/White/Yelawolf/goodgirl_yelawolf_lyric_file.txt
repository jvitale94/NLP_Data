This one’s for the bad girls trying to go good


How could someone like me so bad get such a good girl
Such a good girl, you’re a good girl
And I know that I don’t treat you like I should girl
Like I could girl, like my good girl


Here I go again, on my shit again
Walking through the mall, acting like a prick again
You had a halter-top; I had my Famous socks
You came to shop; I came to ho hop
You had your girl witcha
Both looking great, I wanted both of y’all
How about a double take
She was hating looking at me like a scumbag
But something made you want to turn around and come back
Prob’ly cause I just don’t give a fuck
I just want to see one of these hookas in my truck
So tell your girlfriend tough luck,
She just wanna see you with somebody dressed up
Well, I really ain’t into that type of shit
I’m into tattoos and drinking ‘til six
Fucking ‘til nine, sleeping ‘til twelve
And going back to my homies with a story to tell


How could someone like me so bad get such a good girl
Such a good girl, you’re a good girl
And I know that I don’t treat you like I should girl
Like I could girl, like my good girl


This shit should’a been finished
I’m as surprised as you are, that you still let me in it
But you continue to text message me
Right after saying that we should both move separately
But you don’t want to see me go
Even though I’ve only given you dick and cold cereal
So you must have a thing for lucky charms
Or the bad girl in you just fell into my lucky arms
You love to cuss me out and call me crazy
Say I’m no good and all of your friends hate me
Then you show up to my room and damn near rape me
And then it goes from fuck you, to fuck me baby
You leave early so nobody sees you at the spot
Now you’re stuck between a hard place and a rock
You call me a player, but I have lied to you not
Cause I’m not a player, I just crush a lot. Holler!


How could someone like me so bad get such a good girl
Such a good girl, you’re a good girl
And I know that I don’t treat you like I should girl
Like I could girl, like my good girl


I’m in jail again, on my Johnny Cash
Some dude was talking shit, I had to whip his ass
Called you in the morning, and you just fuckin’ laugh
You think it’s cute, you love my crazy ass
And I wonder if you’ll ever leave my side
Cause the more that I ignore you, the more you wanna ride
I tell you that I’m bad but you never ask why
Cause you just want the good from a really bad guy
You want to rock, let’s rock and roll, just know
I’m only good at one thing and it’s not control
But I am consistent, that’s something to be proud’a
Cause I ain’t shit with you and I ain’t shit without ya


How could someone like me so bad get such a good girl
Such a good girl, you’re a good girl
And I know that I don’t treat you like I should girl
Like I could girl, like my good girl


To all the bad girls trying to be good
There’s no such thing as good girl gone bad girl
Just a bunch of bad girls trying to go good
Alabama, mane!
