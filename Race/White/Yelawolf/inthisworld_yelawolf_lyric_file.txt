Everywhere I go, somebody’s looking at me
And if I ever need something, I’ma get it for myself
Cause I’m the only person thinking ‘bout me
It’s getting hard to be me
Everywhere I go, somebody’s looking at me
And if you gon’ compare me at all best compare me to myself
Cause I’m the only person fucking with me!


In this world of sticks, hicks and chicks with aqua net spray
Sh sh shhhhhh shut up muthafucker don’t disrespect these country ways
Yeah! Alabama, if ya ain’t know,
I ain’t hiding a damn thing, I just like to lean low
Yeah, I’m the theme show
Stereotypical beanpole
Slim, tall, tatted, let me add that I gotta green glow
From all the Mountain Dew that I consume
From a mason jar, in a racing car, chase it with a tall ice brew
Let me not leave you confused, what I represent culturally
Trash bag full of Freon, I’m huffin’ puffin’ on potpourri
That gummo’s squeaky swingin’ gate in front of that trap house
Trailer park is sewed up and Billy done pulled that Lac out


It’s getting hard to be me
Everywhere I go, somebody’s looking at me
And if I ever need something, I’ma get it for myself
Cause I’m the only person thinking ‘bout me
It’s getting hard to be me
Everywhere I go, somebody’s looking at me
And if you gon’ compare me at all best compare me to myself
Cause I’m the only person fucking with me!


Wonder what I got inside this Chevrolet trunk I’m hiding
About ten bodies on a fishing line with baby clothes on consignment
Came to the game so broke that I still find one-dollar bills and get a thrill
That’s the kind of shit that leaves my pickle dill’d
Siding on the single wide got icicle steel, too cold
Gotta kerosene heater to heat up the grill, meatloaf?
Daddy’s in jail again for shuffling pills, we know
Man I’ve only come to give you a peep show, (in this world)
I run across the South, like a wild stream, smiling
I’ve seen more colorful mushrooms than a child’s dream
On an island, desolate left behind
Cause my state, is a state of crime
God said, 1979, go change the minds (in this world)


It’s getting hard to be me
Everywhere I go, somebody’s looking at me
And if I ever need something, I’ma get it for myself
Cause I’m the only person thinking ‘bout me
It’s getting hard to be me
Everywhere I go, somebody’s looking at me
And if you gon’ compare me at all best compare me to myself
Cause I’m the only person fucking with me!


Yelawolf. Hi, my name is
President O‘Bama I’m so shameless
I’m taking it all so what am I saying
I’m the voice of every small town (in this world)
Like a light and a pipe with a mic and take flight in this life
What a sight, put a vice grip lock on my right to fight despite
The way you may feel about sights and sounds that I might put down
About prices found on a sack of that white
Heaven is a place in a 7 11, I can never get away from hell
Found hell in the bible-belt and found love in a 6-pack up on the shelf
Went to the seashore to see more but Leroy didn’t seem sure to me
So I took Leroy to Alabama, he bought the hat and bought the Tee
Converted him y’all, I gave him convertible thoughts
When he saw that big buck hangin’ on the wall (Yeah)
I’m off by a millimeter
I’m on by a million light years and 2 liters a pint of moonshine
I ride a 2 seater, take a ride (in this world)


It’s getting hard to be me
Everywhere I go, somebody’s looking at me
And if I ever need something, I’ma get it for myself
Cause I’m the only person thinking ‘bout me
It’s getting hard to be me
Everywhere I go, somebody’s looking at me
And if you gon’ compare me at all best compare me to myself
Cause I’m the only person fucking with me!
