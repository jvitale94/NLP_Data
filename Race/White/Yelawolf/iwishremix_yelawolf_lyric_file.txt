Suckers can kiss my pickle, adjust your lip up and fucking pucker
I got pull like a trucker, specifically southern Louie the Slugger
Tucked on the Chevy rubber to bust your bubble
Hug your mother, don't lie to your brother
You know Yela's trouble, call the police, look at these bleeding knuckles
Alabama's elephant feet rumble, get pummelled and beat
Underneath the concrete like a street plumber
Give me the bucks from in the trees hundreds of leaves
Cover the? sleeves I got it, believe it momma
Corny motherfuckers we shuck em
And animals, we stuff em, a cannibal, he's bluffing nah
Woke up in the morning with a fucking pen and a pistol
I put one to the paper, I put one to my fears
Stuck up a shop with the pen then I shot up my notebook
I'm reading bullet holes, I wish I fucking would


I wish a motherfucker would tell me that I ain't hip hop
Bitch you ain't hip hop
I wish a motherfucker would tell me that my shit gonna flop
Bitch your shit shit gonna flop
I wish a motherfucker would tell me that I ain't hip hop
Bitch you ain't hip hop
I wish a motherfucker would
I wish a motherfucker would


Hello all my fellow crooks as I let the cigarello cook
I'm kool-aid, I got that ghetto hook
I got a white bitch who said she went to Pebblebrook
Graduated in '03 and love Yelawolf
I got more numbers than a yellow book
And I took more shots than Carmello took
So I'm used to being an underdog
Send my goons to come assault every last one of y'all
No wonder all they brawl take their pajamas off
Look up? whenever I want to call
I'm a convict but I don't wear orange
I'm so raw, catch me in my rare form
I been fly, my momma gave birth to me on a plane
Nigga so I guess you could say I'm airborne
I'm running my city getting my mayor on
Stay on my grizzly, you know I bear arms


I wish a motherfucker would try to run up on me, I keep that clip cocked
I wish a motherfucker would tell that ain't kush that's in my zip look
I wish a motherfucker would tell me I ain't hip hop, bitch my shit hot
I wish a motherfucker would
I wish a motherfucker would


Au contraire mon frere one pure pain giver
Don't ingest this, it might cause corrosion of the liver
Yeah toxic, dropkick opponents on arrival
This ain't hip hop, this is the manual to survival
Take notes fake folks, imitators and lovers
A true to life Jesus risen up from the gutter
I'm awesome, different from the rest of you rappers
And that's real shit, Pill spits exactly what happened
This is chemistry?
Please explain the vivid scenes of what occurred on streets
And I doubt if you know what it really means
Cultural differences divide us and our nemesis
When music is the food for living I think we all forgetting this
Born into poverty, hard torn obviously
That ain't going so we trying to figure out how to eat
Older brother hustling, momma working overtime
Now I'm standing in the kitchen whipping bank it's soda time


I wish a motherfucker would tell me this ain't straight drop yams fresh out the pot
I wish a motherfucker would tell me this ain't a trout spot serving it to a block
I wish a motherfucker would tell me this ain't a yam shop, come and order your rocks
I wish a motherfucker would
I wish a motherfucker would
