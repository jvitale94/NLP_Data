At the coffin
Where's my blue sky?
At the coffin
A pretty bouquet and a red rose
At the coffin
Darling, don't cry
At the coffin
Over my soul

I will take your favorite books, and put them in a row
I remember how you like them, I know where they go
Your mama will be waiting there, for you to hold
I know that she misses you, misses you so

So have a great flight
Have a great flight outta here, I suppose
I know you raised me right, but you must go, I suppose
So have a great flight
Have a great flight outta here, I suppose
I know you raised me right, but you must go, I suppose

I will keep your memories, they always make me smile
Letting you go honestly, I'm having a tough time
I promise I'll be strong for you, like you said, and hold it in the road
But, I've been out here missing you, missing you so

So have a great flight
Have a great flight outta here, I suppose
I know you raised me right, but you must go, I suppose


And nothing ever did feel so real
But this time, my time, my mind is gone
Turn the lights back on, baby I'm in the next room
But is it gonna be long till I see you again?
