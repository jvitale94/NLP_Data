

I am that motherfucker, Lord give me that deuce deuce
I'm out the roof like a chimney sweeper
I'm on Jack and cola
Oh, snap that boy's about to go go pow pow, hold up
Dead at midnight, out like a convict
Trick I'm losing my shit, watch this
Throw a bottle, Fuck the world
I need fight tunes and mushrooms, I'm tripping
(Chicka Chicka) Who's bad?
Baby it's my turn, I want all of it
Hey, let's go
Look, and I'm hating on a trailer park pimp
Who? Me
It's a problem ain't it, man
You're fucking white, you better get used to it
Catfish Billy man
Check the 5-0, in the rear-view
Scheming on the Chevy cause the Chevy's a clear view
Tires wet, pulling me over
With tattoos, I'm a pistol holder
An American fuck up, money like a crook
And I'm spending G's like I'm buying a soda
Check me out, CEO
Got pull like a monster truck so what's up
I earn my shit
Respect is a must
You fuck around with me (shit)
In the slug I trust
I got the Mossberg (shit)
Don't make me load that bunk
James Brown motherfucker (shit)
I took her... I took her to the breakdown like this


Give me everything. Take it all away
Lock me up and then throw away the key
Kick me down and then talk about my state
I'm not out of place. I'm from outer space
I'm not out of place. I'm from outer space
I'm not out of place. I'm from outer space
