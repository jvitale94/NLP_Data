Always had hand salts in a city boy, white skin black chucks
And everybody that wanna challenge me you can do whatever you


Alright hold up stop that, stop that goddamn
I don't think ya'll know what's going on right now
This is the kid, MGK, Machine Gun Kelly, and this the mother fuckin' mixtape, 100 words and running, Lace the fuck up, Kells!

Uhh, Kells, never been a punk
Always had hand salts in a city boy, white skin black chucks

And everybody that wanna challenge me I can do whatever you do but man you bout done
You thought em up
Sleepin on the bottom in on top of the bunk
So when the machine's getting something to eat
You wanna breathe bitch please now use that tongue
But don't use that wrong and tell ya boyfriend who ya used it on
She calling me daddy and her boy Lil' Jon
So if we gotta problem then let's get crunk

I I am what you wishing for the dropout will recieve what you paying your tuition for
Said you wanna rap tell me what you spittin' for
I am the only great white get it what you fishin' for?

Hold up stop stop, I just said I am the only great white and I'm a white rapper
And great white like a shark, what you fishin for,
Ya'll don't get it

OK fuck that bring it back this is what I gotta do to get my city back
No we at the east or the southwest any that
Straight down the middle like a goddamn KitKat
Yea, yea no mornings because there isn't no sleep just yawning
Trying to get a house on the prairie on top of the hill
Now wheres my awnings

Oh and if we recording put this song in the obituary have my manager notify Yonny and tell him I killed his beat I'm sorry

But kells is just a beast like that
Got a beauty on my arm call Disney tell em that the beast is back
We beat that beat this crack show me where the freaks is at
Not a stain on me
You would think I'm where the bleach is at
Up front let me beat the back
Have an uncle like my niece re at
Came with out a snorkel but she show me where her beach is at
Surfs up the cat got me ridin' her body waves positions change now I'm all over her chest like Axe body spray
And she can't even go down and get my rocks off because so many haters dangling they rip my cock off (what?)
Nah, I'm just playin' but yo for real though
How bout you get off my sack and buy yourself a deal yo
Or buy yourself some steals yo sellin 16's like pills yo
I'll get your career rolling, rolling no wheels bro
So what I gotta steal fo even though I'm in the spot that ya'll kill fo
Cause if you watch Finding Nemo ya'll the crill fuckin' meals ho
What the deal yo, what I need a deal for
I got every coast in the country dancing to my songs heel toe
Entrepreneur's hero, 19 years older than zero
Nine digits follow the zeros on my check
Now where's my pillow goodnight
