All we have is right now


Uh, uh, yeah, Staring out into the unknown
Voices in the wind telling me to come home, but I'm scared
Scared that all this time I've been gone I'll open up the door and my little daughter will be grown
And I'm cold, tell me why I'm so cold?
Probably cause a shoulder turns every night that I'm on the road
Probably why I can't smile every time that I'm on the phone
And why I'm acting so wild every time that I'm alone
Save me! I suffocate myself inside the bed trying to cut the circulation
Of these thoughts inside my head like
"Do I hate me? or do I hate them? " Either way I've held grudges since I was holding a pen
My father had me thinking my cousin was dead just to hide me from the truth
How can I look at him again? But this is life, and in life we learning to live
And when the past dies this where it begins cause

Question, What if tomorrow never comes and everything you said today couldn't be undone?
Cause' all it takes is a bullet from one gun to take another's moment away from their one love. I know
See I was just an only child growing up, Just frowns cause' I never seen a smile growing up
But you? You were a friend, always down growing up
Give the word, knew you would've blown trial growing up
Fuck! How could we let all this petty shit blind us?
How the fuck did we let the devil find us?
See, we were supposed to be best friends till' the end
You promised! How'd it take that fucking night to remind us?
I only said I hated you cause you're the only one that's ever honest
Man I said I was wrong, let's get beyond this! But it's crazy
Cause I never thought my text apologizing would be the reason that you died driving. Damn
