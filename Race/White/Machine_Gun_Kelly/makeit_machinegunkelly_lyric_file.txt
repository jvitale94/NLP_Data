24 hours in a dream right?
Well Imma show these people how to dream right
I go to sleep when I wanna live my real life
Cuz wakin up doesnt feel right
So I spend every single moment
Im awoken dreaming on
Teachers pinching me like what is goin on?
And I tell em I'm fine
But they say that I'm wrong
They ask me wheres my mind at
I tell em that it's gone
Somewhere in the crowds of the big city
At all of the shows I got em singin loud wit me
And every night I see fireflies, No owls city
Feet dont ever touch the ground
I'm in cloud city
Lookin back I guess I always had a little less
But I always had the biggest heart in this little chest
My auntie told me I would make it
Just a little guess
Now littles just an understatement
I'm one of the best
I'm one in a million
Look what I achieve
I beat the statistics
I simply believed
Cuz I remember back when people never tried to hear me in my school
And now they like "that kid went to my highschool"
Damn

If you ever thought that you won't make it
As soon as it gets hard you just can't take it
No matter what you're going through keep waiting
Cuz you gon' make it
You gon' make it
Everybody sing
And this is for anyone with a dream
For the single mothers workin you a queen, tell 'em
And this is for the kids who never believed
Matter fact I dedicate this to the streets, sing

Hold up
Let me put my cool back on
Wouldn't be here without my team I put my crew back on
And I'm a rapper but I will not but the jewels back on
My fans love Kells
Let me put the fool back on
No shirt jumping all over the house
Running wild, food hanging out my mouth
Looking like a child
Like I don't know my age
Cuz all I do is smile
And instead of turning new leaves
I jump into the pile
Thats why I kiss my daughter every chance I get
And thank her mother for sticking with me through all this shit
Dead broke in the store traging cans for cents
Almost famous tatted on my now I can't forget
So I dedicate this to the mothers with the kids
To the fathers doing biz
To the teenagers who dont know what having a parent is
To the workers washing dishes
And the players on the benches 
With bigger ambitions you can do it listen

If you ever thought that you won't make it
As soon as it gets hard you just can't take it
No matter what you're going through keep waiting
Cuz you gon' make it
You gon' make it
Everybody sing
And this is for anyone with a dream
For the single mothers workin you a queen, tell 'em
And this is for the kids who never believed
Matter fact I dedicate this to the streets, sing

And this is for
And this is for
And this is for
And this is for
Anyone with a dream
And this is for 
And this is for
And this is for
And this is for
And this is for
The kids who never believed
I dedicate this to the streets sing
I dedicate this to the streets sing
I dedicate this to the streets sing
I dedicate this to the streets sing
