To the top I go
Where I'm from it's cold
But I don't need this coat, keep my sleeves rolled
Got my city's area code on my shoulder
216 forever in my soul
Swear to God every single night it's gets colder
No heat so we all around that stove like
"Fuck this broke shit",
Petty ass hustling, couldn't even sell one zone
Slim still workin at the store and the only time we ever get to eat is when he brings something home
Everyday is dark here,
Praying for a rainbow to lead us to that pot of gold
And exchange those nights on a concrete floor for a bottle of Rose to pop that bitch off like we suppose to

Never gave a fuck if we went gold,
I just wanna be able to say that I made it
Cause' real EST motherfuckers don't fold, real EST motherfuckers don't break up
Real family grows old, Real EST motherfuckers representing for the city where they came even when they gone
And fuck this throne, ain't no kings, no pretty princess, ain't no queen
No fairy tale endings on the east side, just these broken bones and these screams
Broken bones underneath these jeans,
Broken bricks cover up my streets
Friends outside trying to get their fix, while my first born in here trying to get sleep
Motherfuck this rap shit, try burying your boy 6 feet let me show you about real,
Try telling me that you can't make it up out the city 26 dollars to multi-mill's
Face inside of the double XL, then try coming back to the east side still
Well bitch I did, and it's still the kid, labeled a Bad Boy before this deal

What up Slim, Dub, Xplo, Dre, Swirv, Ash, my boy BK
And everybody from the beginning that bled with me knowing I would be here one day

So as I roll through all the hoods that raised me,
Looking at the house of pain
I'm a runaway from the ones that pay me, hoping I'll stay the same.

Can't you save me?
Can't you save me?
Can't you save me?
Can't you save me?
