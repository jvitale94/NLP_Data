

I know, you don't wanna see me right
runnin through the day and night
tryna get my money right 
I know you hate to see me doin right 
Switchin cars and changin flights
Tryna get my money right
And i know and I know and I know and I know and I know
And i know and I know and I know and I know and I know
A-a-and I know, And I know

Untill these dollars in my pockets fat as 10 wallets
Man I'm tryna ball until my paper stretch like Ben Wallace
I got respect, Now i just need power like 10 sockets
Plus I'm fly as fuck
Man I musta came out of the womb with 10 rockets
Gone B-b-blast off
I grinded my ass off
Now my hotels filled with 20 bitches with they pants off
And we blow that cash crop
puff puff pass on
Till the green is gone
shit it looks like we mowed the grass on
CLE man I rep my town
Everyday bleed that orange and brown
Mother fuck what you talkin 'bout
Unless EST comin out your mouth
I'm puttin on my gangin shit
You puttin on your hatin shit
Your girl told me I'm the best
I aint have to say shit

I know, you don't wanna see me right
runnin through the day and night
tryna get my money right 
I know you hate to see me doin right 
Switchin cars and changin flights
Tryna get my money right
And i know and I know and I know and I know and I know
And i know and I know and I know and I know and I know
A-a-and I know, And I know

Ok, everybody knows I be on my jock
....In my city doin anything for a penny
and when I'm in the club ... 50
... like back walk
Nobody ever wanna see me shine
But you cant block the sun
Since I'm a star
that mean we're the same
which means Imma shine no matter what
So call me Kid
Call me Kells
And if you aint about shit don't call my cell
I had my fans before my deal
And they hold me down cuz they know I'm real
Say I'm this
Cal me that
But when I come around 
better tuck your sack
Its EST all around the world
So the whole planet got my back
Fuck your cars
Fuck your clothes
Walk up in the spot take all your hos
20 dollar Levis
I dont need green guys
Alphabet cake baked all them O's
My hotel, My hotel?
You wanna know what happens in my hotel
Is that your girl?
I know her well
She was here last night now bitch go tell

Tryna get my money right
Mic check, Ok

So why you talking down now
Because I run the town now?
Because I'm ring leader of this
and you a clown now
Because you fell off bad as fuck (true)
Because I'm on, you mad as fuck (true)
Because me and my team made it by ourselves you lookin mad at us
Or maybe cuz the streets you call your hood
rock with me more than you
An 'member in the same building the crowd rock watching me more than you
Do i get paid more than you
No but your a fuckin fool
Cuz that girl that you trickin called your wifey chose me over you
Bitch

I know, you dont wanna see me right
grindin through the day and night
tryna get my money right 
I know you hate to see me doin right 
Switchin cars and changin flights
Tryna get my money right
And i know and I know and I know and I know and I know
And i know and I know and I know and I know and I know
A-a-and I know, And I know

Kells
