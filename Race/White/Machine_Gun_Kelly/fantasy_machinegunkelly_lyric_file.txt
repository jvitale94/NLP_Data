

I close my eyes 
Woke up and I saw my dreams
I close my eyes
Woke up and I saw my dreams

Yeah, and they told me
All the glitters ain't gold
But I really wanna shine right now
And they told me the the sky's the limit
So I wonder if I can fly right now
Yeah, so I spread my wings
Jumped up and lived my dreams
I used to always say that I'd be fly
Now I got my head high
In the sky where the airplanes be
And now I'm reachin up for the stars
Almost there
Told me I was dreamin too big
I almost care
Till I hopped in my spaceship
And left the matrix
Through a place where there's no more air
And now I go to sleep
Wherever they wanna be
Openin my eyes seein what they wanna see
And I never aged one year
Still a grown ass kid
You could never tell me what I'm gonna be
Cuz I might wake up
And wanna be king
And see the president 
And wanna be the same thing
Or maybe be a pilot
And find my own island
With a million dollars that I earned last spring
And of course
You know I'd have the worlds prettiest girl
Waitin for me when I go away
An when I get back
Ima kiss her like the very first time
And take her to the malls and say
I want it

I close my eyes 
Woke up and I saw my dreams
Living life like a movie scene
Let me tell you what it feels like
I close my eyes
Woke up and I saw my dreams
And I feel so free
Can't believe this real life

Uh, lights out and the whole city comes to life
See a star shoot past make a wish hope it comes tonight
But until then
Pack my bags put my headphones on
So everything can turn into a dream
And reality seems like I ain't been in my bed for so long
I just wanna fly so high
And escape the real
Into a world that is all made up
So turn my alarm clock off
And lock the door
I wanna sleep until I cant wake up
Now with that being said
Bring me all the girls in the world
In a pool in my penthouse suite
And open up the shades
Get a view of the world
Out a window up 85,000 feet
And then we jump
Lava lamps floatin around us
I guess gravity never found us
They always said whatever you do remain grounded
But Ive always been in the clouds my worlds groundless
So we go up, up, up we gone
And I don't wanna come back down
So Ima do whatever whenever however I gotta do it
To feel like I do right now
Cuz every days good
Every nights great
Yesterdays lobster
Tonight its steak
Spendin my whole life
Lookin for my place
I'm a star
Shoulda known that it was up in space
We all came out of the womb cryin
I ended up shinin
Tell me what you think 'bout that
My life did a whole 360
Front to back
Now I get whatever I want in one snap
And I want it

I close my eyes 
Woke up and I saw my dreams
Living life like a movie scene
Let me tell you what it feels like
I close my eyes
Woke up and I saw my dreams
And I feel so free
Can't believe this real life
And they told me
All that glitters ain't gold 
But I really wanna shine right now
Cant believe this real life
And they told me the sky's the limit
So I wonder if I can fly right now
Cant believe this real life
Yeah all the glitters ain't gold 
But I really wanna shine right now
Cant believe this real life
And they told me the sky's the limit 
So I wonder if I can fly right now

I close my eyes 
Woke up and I saw my dreams
Living life like a movie scene
Let me tell you what it feels like
I close my eyes
Woke up and I saw my dreams
And I feel so free
Can't believe this real life
I close my eyes 
Woke up and I saw my dreams
Living life like a movie scene
Let me tell you what it feels like
I close my eyes
Woke up and I saw my dreams
And I feel so free
Can't believe this real life
