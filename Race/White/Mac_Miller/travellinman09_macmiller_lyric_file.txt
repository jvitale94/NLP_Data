They always remember you
Whether things are good or bad, it's just the memories
Memories don't live like people do (baby don't forget me)
I'm a travelling man, moving through places
Take some time
Got a lot of things I got to do
But lord willing I'm comming back to you, baby boo.
I'm a travelling man, moving through places
Take some time
Got a lot of things I got to do
But god willing I'm comming back to you, baby boo.
I'm leaving on a jet plane and don't know when I'll be back again
Kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me.
Hold me like you'll never let me go.
