

I know people that try, people that don't
People that fly through the air, just float, like smoke
I know people that joke
Know people that's rich, know people that's broke,
Know people that love, people that hate,
Some tell you that you're good,
Some say you're doing great,
Hey, I know people can't wait,
They wanna hear every single thing I gotta say.
Some people act cool, some act phony,
People are your friends, but they'll never be your homies!
I know people think they know me,
Like there's a lame, untalented old me,
Girls wanna own me, labels wanna clone me,
Haters wanna choke me, stoners wanna smoke weed!
People never gonna change,
Cause no two people are the same!


Hey! we are just two people
What more can we do,
Give me one more day,
I'm a spend it with you!
With you!

I can't complain, now people know my name
But when come back home, not a damn thing change!
I bet people can't believe,
Some after the money,
Some want a degree,
If you showing love, then you're cool with me,
I'm the same old dude, before the jewelry
And everything kinda new to me,
Things ain't nothing like they used to be!
People thought I would,
And some people probably thought I could,
Some people think the boy turned at hollywood
Live it up every day, worth while,
Dudes runaway when they see the girl smile.
I'm glad I get to call her mine,
This the type of thing so hard to find!
You can't tell a star to shine or a carpet fly,
Shits gonna happen it's just all in time.


Hey! we are just two people,
What more can we do,
Give me one more day,
I'm a spend it with you!
With you!

Until I'm with somebody, I don't know what to do,
They may not understand you cause they see you only move!
Girl this dinner's over, try'na to get you to my room,
Cause I've been going crazy baby you don't got a clue.


Hey! we are just two people
What more can we do,
Give me one more day,
I'm a spend it with you!
With you!
