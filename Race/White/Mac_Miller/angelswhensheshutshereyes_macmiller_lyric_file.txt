

Uh, I fuck around with amnesia
Towards the over side of my leader
One day I'm a get it all cleaned up
Right now I'm a dirty my jeans up
This what I do, start the day
Picturing back all the pain
All that shit that sort of say
Had a vision, lost it's way
This planet different that we live it, yea, I bet it is
Product of the new world, you stuck in genesis
And I'm just tryna rep my city right like Bettis did
I got a crazy girl that's filled with all these fetishes

And she can get me high, when I'm feeling low
Fill my cup with purple, baby drink it slow
And I can take you anywhere you wanna go
 Don't be afraid

I told her please don't take this back from me
This feeling come so naturally
Exactly what I wanna do, I'm acting so erratically
You get me high, hold me there, this is real girl don't be scared
It's only fair, I warned you that love a drug that can kill you
Got your open heart, I'd have it never
Grown poor to last forever
Hopin' you'll remember what I tell you lookin' in your eyes
Don't be afraid of what can get you high
Just hold me tight and watch the seconds fly
I wonder where will I meet her
The perfect girl that I dream of
For now don't need no huge tits, I'm a cool with just a good B cup
Uh, you're now free to ball, build it up then keep it all
She don't need to call, if love demanded now we could roll
And we drive there, say everything that we not said
I'm telling you that you hard to trust
You say you're not, got a hard head
This forever, don't you ever think to let me go
And if I'm talkin' to the world I need to let 'em know

And she can get me high, when I'm feeling low
Fill my cup with purple, baby drink it slow
And I can take you anywhere you wanna go
 Don't be afraid

I told her please don't take this back from me
This feeling come so naturally
Exactly what I wanna do, I'm acting so erratically
You get me high, hold me there, this is real girl don't be scared
It's only fair, I warned you that love a drug that can kill you
Got your open heart, I'd have it never
Grow apart or last forever
Hopin' you'll remember what I tell you lookin' in your eyes
Don't be afraid of what can get you high
Just hold me tight and watch the seconds fly
