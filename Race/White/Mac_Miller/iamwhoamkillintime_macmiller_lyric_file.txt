

I'm posing a question, how many been empty and holding aggression,
Close to depression, open your eyes and just focus a second
Fucking recession might bother my mind's always moving I'm letting it go
Know that I'm pointing at negative energy, telling me stop
They're telling me no, don't
Your aura is something you ain't even sure of
Explore the core of California, hoes got more to snort up
I've had a smorgasbord pornographic thought
That's a lot, the feeling come after the shock
Praise me I'd rather you not, cause
It's driving me crazy the fact that you pay to make me into something I love
You come to the club searching for drugs, drunk
Fucking these sluts
God loves me, what if he does, what does it mean?
You're wasting away doing nothing, you're fronting
Why ain't you chasing your dreams?
We wonder 'bout life but none of us willin' to learn
The money we earn is something to burn
Why won't they give me a turn-out?
Feed the hungry and clothe the naked
You're mistaken, the world is cold and it's lonely, ain't it?
When 'em high roller homes in Vegas raid them with some home invasions
Contaminating the place with plague, we just saved the day
I waste away in a room spitting these raps
Yahweh put the world in my hands, I'm giving it back

Forfeiting the war, he lays his sword down and walks away
Grabs a 40 from the corner store and begins to contemplate
Dealing with death like he worked in the morgue absorbing the souls
Forgotten, he lost his way
Starring down that barrel, thinking not today
Life is so precious, Lord knows that life is so precious
Fight to the death, till there's nobody left
You're holding your breath cause you might get infected
I'm animalistic, instinctively thinking I'm gettin' ballistic
Be specific, to those in control, we all statistics
Misogynistic with a twisted mind, I'm intertwined
My trigger finger itching, all I kill is time
Initial symptoms of schizophrenic behavior
The mind is like religion, can't agree on who's its savior
The newest flavor of superhero, I'm shooting lasers
Except I'm cool invader and blowing up rooms full of strangers
A news anchor, the youth can-relate-er, it's nature
If you're a hater, I'll deal with you later, no thank you
I'm just your neighbor, please don't do me no favors
Really doe, come on homie we major
I waste away in this room spitting out raps
Yahweh put the world in my hands, I'm giving it back
