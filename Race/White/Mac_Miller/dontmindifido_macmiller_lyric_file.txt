Mhm
Don't mind if I do

Hey, it seems like every day
I gotta filled up phone
Ladies tryna text me
Sayin that they home for the Summer
And they heard that I'm livin on my own
So they wanna come to the crib
Maybe cook me some supper
But I'm busy, so I'm ignorin her
Yeah I just touched down in California
Now I'm headed to the beach
Gon' swim in the water
Like I'm tryna sneak in across the border

I do, all different types of crazy shit
I'm the youngen hoes tryna make a baby with
'Cause it'll make 'em rich
Know I'm headed to the money
So these funny little girls wanna take a trip
But no, only the M.O.S.T. dope with me
Other fools home or, boy? and cig free

No disrespect though,
I gotta get that cigarette flow
For the green pesto, presto


I'd like to make myself believe
That planet earth turns, slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm a sleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems

Me I'm highly underestimated
So educated that gettin paid quick
If you ever hated anticipate that I'm famous
Got a bunch of bitches to sip on the champagne with
Celebrate that we seein' another day, life good
Never wanna end this
Me & Mary Jane got a really nice friendship

Yeah they give me money
But I gotta go and spend it
Man, I been a bad little jew
But I gotta pay the bills now
So I gotta chill out
I ain't walkin round like I'm splurging with a mil now

Feel like the kid workin at the mill now
Used to just chill and smoke joints up at Bills house
Now I gotta schedule, things I gotta do
Doin' interviews, see it up on youtube
I say it feels just like a dream
'Bout to wake up from a nap
How fucked up was that like


I'd like to make myself believe
That planet earth turns, slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm a sleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems

Just some motha fuckin' kids
We just some motha fuckin' kids
