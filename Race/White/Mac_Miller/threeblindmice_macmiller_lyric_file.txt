Boy, my bar so clean need to rewind twice
Gotta board a spaceship just to reach my height
And soon these magazines will relieve my height
Your bars are clever, my “R’s” are better
Play with constellations, bring the stars together
Going hard forever, I'm never gonna stop
Have em hold they breath everytime the beat gon’ drop
Reebok pumps and a crewneck sweater
Gotta chest bar ready but you wanna play checkers
Stella-ella-olah, clap-clap-clap
Tell that little chicka-chicka to bring that ass back
M-A-C M-I-L-L, -E-R that is how you spell
My name bitch, don’t you forget it, and Imma go hard with every sentence


You can get with this or you can get with that
Everytime I meet a chick, she wanna get with Mac
That’s just how it is, listen to my song
So if you feeling good, clap your hands and sing along

Hey, my name’s Mac and its nice to meet ya
I'm all about my cheese like a slice a pizza
So high that Imma type of fever, looking fresh with a new pair of Nike sneakers
Used to be the kid that they thought was a fool,
Badass, momma never taught me the rules
I'm clean, you got some laundry to do, not you ho, nobody was talking to you
On Pluto, see the way I walk on the moon
Gotta cool flow, loadin up my rocket to shoot
Like boom yo, it go bla-oww, so how the fuck you like me now
Cuz my style so unorthodox, this some ham an eggs shit, got some pork and chops
Got em going crazy like a half court shot, you hatin’ cuz I'm cool and perhaps your not



You can get with this or you can get with that
Ha ha-ha ha-ha ha, ha
Alright y’all, to the beat y’all, party rock y’all, to the beat y’all
Hey ho, hey ho, hey ho
And that is the way it goes
