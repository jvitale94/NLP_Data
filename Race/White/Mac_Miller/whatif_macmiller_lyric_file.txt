What if I’m never famous?
What if, I’m broke
And my whole life been a joke?
What if nothing never happens?
What if I gotta stop rapping?
What if, what if, what if this is it?

What if I never get the chance to tell the world what I gotta say?
When I die all I do is just ride away
I tried to talk about my life in every song
So you have a little something to remember when I’m gone.
I tell it like it is, I ain’t pretending that I'm on
But I tell you that I’m working and I’m getting very strong
It won’t be long till you hear me on the radio
But in my head I got ways to go
But I'mma take it slow, this is the way to blow
So any place I go, I know my bank can row
The old heads are schooling me I’m taking notes, I am hip hop
It replaces my soul if I sink to the bottom then I'mma make a float.
I heard the real world’s cold, I’mma take a coat
Be prepared, and be aware cause failure ain't really even there

What if I’ll never make it?
What if I’m never famous?
What if, I’m broke
And my whole life been a joke?
What if nothing never happens?
What if I gotta stop rapping?
What if, what if, what if this is it?

Expectations peeking, they wonder what I’m about to do
Spark interest, music I can count on you, right? 
Or do I have it all twisted? I went from popular to misfit in an instant
My friends forgot me cause they probably seen me hardly
In the lab when I should be out at a party
It drives me crazy, money is the fuel
Insomniac, awake finding something I can do to put the work in and
I'm certain that I'm flirting with the fame
Failure getting jealous, throwing dirt upon my name
Burning up my brain, but I’m working through my pain
Cause life’s hard, till you learn it’s just a game
Play your cards, use your letters on your scrabble board
If you’re smart, put your heart into your rapping more
No money? why the fuck you’re counting for?
A thousand tours trying to get up my allowance more

What if I’ll never make it?
What if I’m never famous?
What if, I’m broke
And my whole life been a joke?
What if nothing never happens?
What if I gotta stop rapping?
What if, what if, what if this is it?
