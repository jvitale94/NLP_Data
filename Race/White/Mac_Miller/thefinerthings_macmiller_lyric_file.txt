I like sitting in shotgun deuce on an L, parents not caring cause they used to the smell.
Classy ass women, fresh ass linen, hot summer dayz w/a pool I can swim in, a good spot to kick it, a case full of 40s,
Them homies always havin good stories, the beer bottles with the twist off caps, when old people tell u they listen to rap,
I love days I can sleep in, 4 day weekends, hoes puttin ther clothes back on u peekin, blunt rides w/the mixtape bumpin. I love makin love in public, n when the hip hop legend tour comin to your town, findin a crispy ass 20 on the ground, walkin with the sun out, watchin runs house, reaction movies when the villain pull his gun outtt.

The best in life is the free ones, ahh, the little things everybody need some, the finer thingggs make u feel betttter but no one ever seem to remember, the best things in life is the free ones, the little things everybody needs some, the finer thingggs make u feel betttter but no one ever seem to remember

I'm like sleepin in class, I'm cheatin to pass, hoes walkin in the halls n u reach for their ass, fast food lines when they movin so quickly, when your weedman hit u with some sticky, street performers warmin up the corners, sellin by the ounce & pitchin by the quarter, where some kicks on sale, wakin up in the morning w/a shitload of mail, the wake up the bake up, chillin while u face blunts, going in blowed (be it shape up?) like say what? what? blog put your tape up, get a good review, when dumbass people tell you what u should'ntdo, when she rub my head when I'm b/w her kneees, ha, getting love from the people overseas, haters tryina hate but they got nothing to say,
