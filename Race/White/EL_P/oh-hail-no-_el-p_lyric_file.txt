 Ever notice when you talk I just cut myself?
 On some ultimate f*ck you, go f*ck yourself
 Like that was so heartfelt, you really touched yourself
 I loved the part where you cried, I liked nothing else
 Who me? Every breath is a criminal, critical breach
 Bloody guns, speech, beat minimalisimo
 Make you spin like you sniffing that god particle
 That purple cloak of the dusk, an odd article
 Originator decay, caterwaul brand, dawn treader rising
 Hollow man bop, gliding
 Shuffle through the tides of slime smiling
 Could be the high or just mind control dying
 F*ck it throw me on the problem pile
 I'm a grin from the garbage, stained parchment
 Peeking out of my blinds in the apartment
 Waiting for that "Hark hear that archangel calling?"

 Pocket full of air plus nothing to wear
 I've been told I was put here to fail
 Never ask me to hail
 Never ask me to hail
 Never ask me to hail
 I'm strapped in shaved head in an electric chair
 With a grin going out with a flair
 Never ask me to hail
 Never ask me to hail
 Never ask me to hail

 Jesus turned water to wine, I turn liquor to urine
 Sex with one whore is deplorable I need four at a time
 Maybe I'm lost in the grind, conscious of all I desire
 Forcibly caused to be normal, bonded and tossed in the fire
 Cross hairs of corporate design, cogs that all move in align
 Meant to be something other than this but I think I forgot
 Shyamalan twist in the plot, Camelot sword from the rock
 No I won't piss in your pot, life put that bishop in pac
 Visceral, villainous, vindicated by venomous vibes
 Vicious, concealing, my mental illness by willing a smile
 Endless, intentions to climb, uphill and piss in the sky
 (Brooklyn is up in this motherf*cker so suck on our) cock

 Never ask me to hail
 Never ask me to hail
 Never ask me to hail

 Check! The natural magician, these rappers' nutrition
 I'm sh*tting on their writtens while I'm pissing on their freestyles
 My patterns are argyle, your's more checker board
 My lecture is Lector, your texture is pocket protector
 With techniques I take off your sector
 Inspector Gadget with the ratchet
 B*tch won a beauty pageant, bought her ass a rabbit
 But not a furry bunny b*tch I'm all about these moneys
 Ah! Tummy empty and I'm dazed when sunny
 So I had to sell crack 'cause I ain't wanna be bummy
 Granny gave me couple dollars while she played gin and rummy
 Off that Mobb Deep sh*t had me saying dunny
 Done. This n*gga here is not a dummy
 Look at all that he has done, you n*ggas feeling crummy
 Gummy bear you running where?
 It's like a fat b*tch running a hundred stairs
 I'm Rick Flair, with thick hair
 Yelling out "Woo!" getting head in the director's chair
