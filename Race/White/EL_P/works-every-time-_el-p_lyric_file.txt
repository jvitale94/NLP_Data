[Verse 1]:
I've been waiting for you all week. Don't you know this a rotten time to not not be me
I've been waiting for an hour now, what the fuck is up?
I've got memories to lose man. I am in a rush
Don't make me suffer this dimension straight. When we can bend face. Let space pixelate
60 dollars for a new born you. Pay no attention to these savages. They don't own truth
Pay no attention to the man behind the glass, he smirked
I tried the old way, that advice you gave to me was dirt
25 and I can buy my way of planet nerf
Where the softest hearts are tossed around on astro turf
Charlie Brown is a dope boy trumpets fade
And its ridiculous to say oblivions insane
And its insanity to think I'd recognize my name
I no longer speak the language, I have chosen change

[Hook]:
Its like a fresh start to a new world (And I'd do anything, anything anything)
To go home
It's like a fresh start to a new world
And I already want to go home

[Verse 2]:
Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit sniffing glue
If I exist right now I damn sure can't provide you proof
Definitions of existence in this state of loose
You've done an awful ? tying up my noose
You had the fucking nerve to outstretch calm point in me
But can't you tell by how I'm sweating I am finally free
You were right about me, all along, whoop-de-doo
I have disappeared and so have you

[Hook]:
Its like a fresh start to a new world (And I'd do anything, anything anything)
To go home
It's like a fresh start to a new world
And I already want to go home
