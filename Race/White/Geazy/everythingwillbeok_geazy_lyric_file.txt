Everything will be okay
Everything will be okay
Everything will be okay
(Okay, okay)

Contemplating just who I could've turned out to be
If I stayed there with her, what would amount to me?
If I looked and ain’t found what I have founded me?
I mean, it’s hard, but they loved me, never looked down on me
They say, "You know if you loved her
Well then you would have stayed
You could have made a perfect pair that people wouldn't trade"
Trade for nothing, I did though, I had to chase it
Face it, I wasn’t born to live a life basic
They say, "you turned your back on us just to go and be an artist
What's a promise anyway when someone breaks it?
I bet he finally gets a shot and then he wastes it
I bet he don’t come back for us when he makes it
And if he do it be too late, you gotta face it
Cause by then there's someone new you've been replaced with"
Old friends I grew up with, the girl I fell in love with
Love or hate me depending on how you judge it


Even if I don't stay
Everything will be okay
Everything will be okay
(I promise it'll be okay)
Everything will be okay
(Okay, okay)

I had to wander, I had to go tread my own path
If you don't step through no mud well then it won't last
The years pass it's crazy how they go fast
Ask myself questions that you have but you won't ask
Like, "you don’t even come home enough
Where were you when she was in the hospital, huh?
It was only us," and that’s deep and yeah I know it cuts
But if it gets you, then you’re weak
Because we were here and it ain’t broken us
Still as close and stayed by her side when no one was
Like when she lost her job and everything, how broke we was
When she was sick and she needed some taking care of
A fifteen year old shouldered the weight
And when he was scared of
The worst, I know that you stayed strong
Don’t say this enough
But you made me just as proud as you made Mom
Yeah, you got some anger but I don’t blame you at all
I know I don't call, but you're my brother, I love you


Even if I don’t stay
Everything will be okay
Everything will be okay
(I promise it’ll be okay)
Everything will be okay
(Okay, okay)

In that first grade class they came and got me
"Your mom's outside, say goodbye now to everybody"
U-Haul was waiting with all of her things
At least what she could pack
In the time my dad's at work and before he came back
Way to young to comprehend what was happening
"Are we going to grandma's? When are we coming back again?"
Little did I know that we were leaving him by himself
And ten years would pass before Mom sees anybody else
Just us, in middle school I ain't understand
Who Melissa was and why she wasn't another man
Biased and confused they try to explain but nobody can
Wanted what I thought was normal, she had another plan
Such is life, even if it took time for me to accept it
No longer Dad now, but a woman with whom she slept with
Or for the years when a secret was how she kept it
I ain't get it, admittedly I was skeptic
I came around, happiness I see's what you may have found
And that's what's most important
I don’t wanna see you breaking down
I wanna see you smile, I don't wanna see you make a frown
If she loves you, then that's all anybody needs maybe now
By '05 things had gotten worse
Moved to the basement, deep depressions a rotten curse
Hiding in a dark space, her mind and her body hurts
Becoming more reclusive and the pills should have been alerts
So the worse it got, I became more and more afraid
Until one night, I went into that room, on the floor she laid
I shook her she was blue, her skin was cold, she wasn't breathing
Screamed, "Melissa wake up" couldn't fathom that she was leaving
Mom and Bro was running down, I screamed "somebody help"
Try pumping her chest, CPR, but it didn’t help
Toughest pill to swallow, but we lost, that’s forced reflection
While in her life you made her happy, thank you for the blessing


Even if I don’t stay
Everything will be okay
(It’ll be, it’ll be okay)
Everything will be okay
(I promise it’ll be okay)
Everything will be okay
(Okay, okay)
